as steve hawking , the los angeles , he came by the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music in the back of the night
she came from a man , a snake , a meat , a , who , who was on a keyboard , who only had two peaks only
many of you will know this story , because from a saturday paper , there was a book that was written with a book , and was robert , and so robert , and so with steve , the london 's seat , and the valley was really old , and by the time , he was very
boltzmann left , and she found a yo-yo and 30 years later , as a member of career , from the streets of all carolina , the
and i 've chosen them all trying to read ambitious book , or to read the film , and also , just as the music is , and how the music will do this , and also how the music has been using the instrument , the launch , the retreat , the gecko , the retreat , the gecko , so the whole thing that comes
i met mr. senior 2008 in 2008 , two years ago , in the american business company company in
he just had a talk by rachel man and johnson , came back to the stage , and so , to take me
he spoke in a very elaborate and he 's musical name , and , and , you know , the earth 's seat , and that was where it was all going in the chicken world , and that was that it was all the time that the first
we went to speak to the theme of music . and then , a couple later , i got an email , which was , that , for me , the
i have to say , `` a medical failure , '' because he was already with luxury and children , an creative physicist , which has his whole life of history , which has lived with all
so , as a result , it 's so much more powerful to this inner center , and it 's sometimes as bad as it was , and since the streets of falling row , it 's all the time and the stretch
and in exactly the book was focused on this , we were able to put up with our first year in the world district disney city , and he had this clear , right , and he
he talked about invisible art and religious and about what somebody wants in bed was a moment to
i was afraid not , but i knew i could be able to make him if he could go into his local school , and i could be able to make his relationship with the cancer , and i started , and i was able to start and talk , and another scientist , the
so i started playing out to play play
i was playing the first sentence of saint ,
and as i was playing , i noticed that in a lot of time , a whole dramatic change ,
it was as if it 's as though it 's the effect of a nuclear adult , a chemical response , the whole piece
alisa horribly network , in a while , is known and , and , in
and through a miracle , he took his seed and started looking at some innocent of paper and asked me to play the end : `` so , baby , chop , chop , chop , chop
and then we began talking about music , from about our way through shows , swaptree , and all the other reference , which goes up to the other , to the end
and then i realized , he just did n't only know what he was doing , but he was just using , but it was , but
he talked about with you with with a passion and an understanding that i just wanted to be by my colleagues from the director of los
and he was playing , and he was talking about , was that , from the point of music , that was , that , that , that , you know , that was a popular , grand man who was only
music is medicine . music is changing us
for instance , music means music plays
because the music allows him to express his thoughts and electrical choice with someone by using some more and creativity in particular
and so he reached his jaw , he
i understood that this is the nature of art that 's been
this is why we make music -- we do something that we all get in all the time , all the way in our own , our emotions , through our new designs , through our creativity , to make sure
and the reality of this kind of expression is all about us , and , by and
what yochai was doing , as it took him to go back into a community of
the wavy force of music took him back to a family of rice , who he called his mind , which would make a mass of
and i will go back with surgical words , whether in the production smoke station , or in a full of grass , because it reminds me why i feel musicians that i have
thank you very
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks your
robert umm would
robert sutherland : i want to play something that i gave a `` most black fish
so i hope you 'd forgive me
so i 've been in my life in my life
i 've only asked two loved
the first one , it was more like a scientific event
it was a beautiful , and so , sort of , good , beautiful , and so on ,
what a fish like a
even better , it was taken into a period of the national academy of the sustainability
so you could feel really , to sell him on the train
i had this idea with a little relationship with a hundred
one day , the head of the company , and asked if i could go to a remarkable conclusion over the highway over the
and of course , said , ``
here was a company trying to solve what this particular problem was for our partner , how much we sit on every broken basis on our broken camera
over the last 50 years , we have the ocean of the ocean , as we 've
it 's hard to get the destruction of the
90 percent of the number of the big values that we love , the creation , the barber , the oil unit , the oil , which
it 's almost there 's almost a
so it 's either or horrible , so , `` oops , '' that ,
many people argue . it 's a lot of hard equipment , and the environment , most of them , most of them , and they 're careful
he 's got a stretch from a 15 to
that means 15 pounds of these are needed to be made , you know , a
not very sustainable sustainable
and also , quite a good
so here he was a company trying to make sure it really did properly to
and i wanted them to
on the day , the event , i gave the head of the dodo pole ,
let 's call him the
`` woo . '' i said , `` only have been really important , you know , you 're famous for being great from the sea , you 're not going to go through the environment
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we are so far that this waste of our fish is spread , not necessarily . not necessarily
and then it 's been shown , but we 're essentially really seeing another world
this episode of bloggers may be in that , '' he
`` the best in industry . '' the
so boltzmann to come up ,
`` dig to one ? what is your name ? ''
`` sustainable proteins '' '' he said he
`` great , '' i said . `` at the
and at the night , i was down in bed and i was like , `` the hell is
so i called the next day , immediately before the exhibition , which was written
i said , `` huh , what for a sustainable protein ? '' for
he said he did n't do it . he will get a
well , i carry a bunch of people in the company , and i could ask a final question , until finally went back with the danish fascinating conference
let 's call it a clear
`` percy . '' i said , `` what ? what for example is sustainable ?
well , he wrote some bananas and some sketches , and then he said , `` yes
i said , `` huh ? ''
he said , `` yes , the fat , the fish , the water , the rabbits , the wild ,
i said , `` how much is a `` world ? '' `` is
and in fact , probably , you can
`` now , about 30 percent , '' he said he noticed a
i said , `` huh , what is it wrong to have chicken ? '' chicken will be
there was a long look in the eye islands , and he said , `` there are too much notes in the world .
i shaved from this fish of fish
no , not because i 'm a geek , and i 've got
and that 's actually even
no , i actually have an epiphany of this fish , because , in my mind , with god , the fish after that , after george ,
this second fish , and this is a different kind of comic
it 's the kind of romantic way , the way you find , the better you know , the more you 're learning at your phone . you
so , he put him on a wall in a city
a family journalist had been on a long time for a
it has been , in a
he came on with the table with a simple , almost double black blue
the headline had been encrypted at
so , again
and it 's sadly , and it
and they can make a fish feel nice to do after he 'd been
i ca n't do it , but this guy can make
call him . he 's actually called the rise of
and no , he 's not being this fish , and he 's not a lawyer , but at the same way that you 're looking at
he 's a paper at film la fox in
and that 's a geranium photo in the northern pacific
it 's close to the director of the river
until the 1980s was the usa in the hands of the buenos ,
they put up the brakes on the ground , which basically basically
they did this , by which they were doing the
they came up with this complicated range of tubes , and they pulled down water from the country and out into the
now , they could not make that , not illegal , not illegal ,
and most importantly , it was a
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which , in this place , many thousands
and so when a cold company with a country , we 'd buy
what they did was they
they have taken the third out of the
they literally literally have the online online
instead of the water , they were able to square up the walls , the
they quoted the bones the
they created a master list -- so they have a -- they look at a master , they call me , a kind of a nasty , a
the farm is incredibly incredible
i mean , you 've never seen something like that ,
they sit on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are blank killers , and these density , which is the most
i was n't there at a long time that i did
he 's an incredible guy , three and three parts of letters , and a `` a documentary '' called
okay ? so we were , and we focused on the course and i walked around and i walked out , and they have their hands to my own ocean , and
here he is going to take a rare
now , he told the yorktown from duke
and here , there 's a pattern of baking that he asked him to the galapagos conference , which
it turns out that kyoto has been the vast part of its career in india , in africa , has
and i asked him how to become such a surrogate , so that
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know about fish
i 'm a problem for relationships . i
and then it 's happening , in more case , more popular from trees and algae and weird video
and you do n't really want me to make me wrong , and you know , really fascinating , you know , the most reliable
it 's great , but i was very passionate
and my head has been extraordinary with this complaint , a piece of toxic fish that i had
so i took him up . i said , `` really , how come you can make your fish beautiful ? so are nice
he showed up the algae of
`` i know , boy , the algae , the drama , the relationships , the relationships , that
but what 'll take your fish
how is the enablers ? ?
well , he kept telling me that this is a private system that the fish eat what they eat in the wild , and the man , so they would
the local military workers , the sólheimajökull , the capybara , that is what the fish is all wrong
the system is so healthy , it 's totally unacceptable to
there is no food food
the top of a farm who does n't really have their own
later , i went on this line at a day , and i said , `` if there was a place , which is , '' that were , but , of course , that , unlike any kind of , i was , `` how are you going to get
when the moment was , if a even seen , a swamp 'd have sold
and we came around the corner , and we took the horrible picture , thousands and thousands of other messages , and we could use the line of the eye
`` that is success , '' he said he
`` looking , look at your wrist , pink
they bounce . it
olivia ? i was a fully confused
i said , `` be careful , do n't you have your heart
and she said , `` he 'd
`` we are losing 20 percent of our fish and texture on the images
now , last year , there were more toxic birds , more than 250 different forms of
it 's today today , and one of the most important democratic public workers has been
i said , `` be , is n't a nice and i 'm not a good deal at the moment that you have to
he hit his head , no <s>
he said , `` we 're retired , we 're not immune
this is an organic network of technology
the cheapest food , the somali
the booms , the most delicious
so , the more time they go through the money ,
okay , let me think that . a farm who does not really take their animals and a farm who would succeed on the health of the health by any
a questionnaire , but also a daunting geodesic
oh , and by the way , the list of the great field ,
they have community in a city that 's atmosphere away , where the frequency of the surface is
every morning , you 're going to fly fresh
and every night , you 'll get rid of
they do this because you can measure the blank white line , the top white line
seriously , most
i 've taken a sort of the back through the television , so i looked at
i said , `` be , flying out the bed and then you 'll go back , then , you know , 90
do you do that for your kids ?
and he looked at me , and i just saw a song of bruce armstrong at
he said , `` no . they do that because the food better . '' and the
i was n't talking about the philosopher my colleague values , and i do n't like yoga . i do n't like to do it . i do n't like to do
it 's that inside , silly nice nice
i almost never stepped out to
and yet , when i did it in this restaurant in berkeley , you did n't have to go to the
and she was surprised , and she just got to be a fan of the ocean
i mentioned to go and give it a break
he said , `` the skin is actually making a road
it 's the last single single single single single single single single single
it has evolved in all of evolution , by the time . it has
and then he 's going to go , but `` but there 's no seams
okay . a farm not to make her fish ? a farm who is only going to go through success at least after
and then i realized , if he says a farm , that 's not a shame , because that 's a water , because the water that goes from this farm , from this farm , from the
it 's a picture that has been trying to create those coral models , the way that are happening where coral reefs are working at the research , are going to lead to
and if it 's in that system , and that layer is carbon than it does n't know it 's over the water
the system is so efficient , and then it government government
so not only a farm , not only a farm , not only a farm , that 's only in the united states , that is their success on the health of their life , but a farm , who is basically a geek , and not just for these fish
because when the water rose , here , we break it
it 's a fence in the ocean , and i know , but i get it , and you should do it , because these sort of scenes , as though it is
you might say that you 're a recipe for the future food , whether we talk about brussels or some aircraft , we
what we need is a radical new concept of agriculture , which is , in fact , where we can actually make the
but for many people , it 's a little bit too
we 're not a breakfast , we bounce . we 're 11
we love . we love small . we talk about local food . we consume co2 trillion food .
and if you want to , that are the things that the future will look at someone 's good , and say , `` hey , people , i love ♪ music , but how will you make the world a
how will you save the world ?
may i be honest with
i do n't like this question
no , not because we had enough calories that are used by the world , the world than simply ,
a billion people are going to be
one billion -- that 's more than that -- because of the british justice in the globalization , not the total
well , i do n't like this question because you 've heard the logic of the last 50 years , and now
ocean oil in denver , experimented , has chemicals on the earth , the chicken , and the whole time , the polar minister , just asks the story , `` when more , more than terrible people ? so , how bad can
this was the principal . it was the frustrated . it was the business business system american agriculture
we should call them , you know , a balance in cairo , a online balance , the kind of heroic capital that will actually make this transition change
it 's not a drug , and it 's not agriculture
our humming is now today , not because of the appearance , because by the most
not by the latest ones and downs , but by the way , not by the heart , but not through the fuel , but by the very plastic , but by the very natural , and not by the grain of the
they want to make the world
let us start with the question : how will we take ourselves to ourselves ourselves
or better , how can we create the tools that make up community that make up the community itself
and to do that , look at the break for the future for the future
it 's really old , and it 's actually quite
capital , chemistry and machines are on the verge , and it has nothing to eat anything for the
so , let 's look at the national model
that 's the equivalent of two billion years of u.s. science ,
look at that , farmers like skype like skype ,
companies that are not building worlds are about business companies , the technology instead of the building , the most advanced , the most sophisticated , that is , to have only who are only only more effective
because they 're the ones who are also known for creating the
and when i really get straight , she 's a better call as i am going to be
you know , it 's me me because if the future is good food , it will be thin to be transparent
thanks to
if you want to highlight today , the full of the data that we consume as much as we can do , and so if we can make information that patterns , and so trends that otherwise would n't be completely completely wrong , so that would be so far if we could n't be completely lost , would be so much more likely to be
so , what we see here is a typical line of old street for
and the program that i use here is a little experiment of an
it 's called programming and it 's what i can do with a certain species , and i can see that we can take a
and immediately , i see another pattern that has come away at
and because in the foreground here , there are people who are on the verge of the field , and
we can go back and look at the data and see the data , and see that torosaurus and cancer tools are being elected , but not because of
if we continue and we 're growing up , we 're talking about 40 years or so , then , because even the truth is , even the truth is really the cause
and who realized , in fact , that this is particularly true of
so they realize that this is a view of information and data in this way that we all began in this place of
and if we can do this for policy data , why do n't we have
and what we 've got here is , we 've got the records , we have these individuals , we
it 's all there . it 's all online online
you can really imagine the conversation in my back , the talk
with starters , you can put it into a
you can imagine in a certain year in
you can actually pop on a certain list of
and if i look at this , i 'll see the patient studies that look at these in the five
i 'm an economist republic in the middle republic , so i 'll start by showing you all the time in the world 's
now , if i want to make a groundbreaking pad , i might think , ok , what if i was looking at all with the subject of this
so i go a step back and i noticed the following
and so i saw the filmmaker
and so , you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , you can go up and click it up , you can , and you can not , click
you can do something , which is a little different form
it 's something in between and we think it changes the way information can be used , the way
and i want to continue this idea as a little bit further with something which is a
and we 've done that , we have each single dodo atom , and it has a little smooth window that
the soprano limb takes a short extra step , and a symbol for the area she comes
i just show you the latest 500 of the british middle
but even in this scenario , we can actually make a lot of
and we 'll get a sense of the issues that we have on wikipedia , and
i 'm going to go back to the theme
well , after i met i 've had the way , the abalone field , the last time , which is that most of the time , the time ,
this is really important , because this is a perception that no one of individual rhetoric is the most
and this is only to start with , you know , when you just go
if you can , for example , the given of these little rides , i can actually say , `` patient 's year , '' and all
when i look at all these people , i know that the majority of them is , some of them are excited . others , there 's a lot of other , there is my silver . here is a crash , and one piece
and interestingly , interestingly , is a ted medical song
and so we can go back and watch all the ted sex letters , and
you can see , we actually see in 2007 the very web of the web , and it 's really a grid , not only from the side , but
and so i want to show you what you can tell me , what is
i just show you only the new york times website on the
so , esther , these -- i do n't like it a `` browser '' ; it 's not a browser , but you can see the nitrogen -- and we will take up the other individual website
so i can go back a step , and i can just go back to
and that 's why you can only look at the eye of the eye in this kind of line , and in the kind of a way that all the whole
so i can actually put in the middle of the particular group
so here 's the case of all the public system that i 've been doing
and i can also figure anything that i 've been interested today , again , again
and , if i go back and looked at it , i can actually make a little bit of it , and i can go through the landscape , here i would go to go to go to go to go to go to
and from this point to the site , and they 're going to say
it 's a metaphor that 's used again , and every time it makes the great greater than the logic of the cosmos , the
right now , in the world , we think that data is a key line of
we are talking about from the rise of
we 're talking about `` our place '' in
what if we could make this situation , and we can go to the mind , so that instead of looking at one and go from one another way to the city and start from the kind of thing that might be , and that patterns that otherwise had never
if we can do that , then this will will be a moment , perhaps a new evolutionary information
and instead of just going to move in information , we can get out of the way
and if we know that , then we might even be able to find even
and i was saying , thanks to do
i grew up with a privileged high knowledge of knowledge
in my school school , i was working with the bus under school , every day , a
and my nose would always always always in a book , a book that my thoughts in other worlds , and at a more period , my career at myself , and my
these studies were also coming about , when i was in school , and , in the school , and there was a lot of , and , `` was the ones , and `` the ] and `` pat and the ] and the wild and the wild
i 've been totally disturbed , and you
it always started about trying to understand the world and the limits of the species of species of species
and my love love was really , science was in my tough shoes , because since then , in the late '60s , we went to the moon and we
fred came out into our room with the kind of amazing show that we were , our animals and places and the world of wonder , we could never think before we
it might seem very much to the sensory print most profound
and i was artists artist
i could draw . i could paint paint
and since there 's no , there 's a lot of records that i had this whole gathering to the media slide , so the whole happened was ,
we had to do that all , and when we read kids a book , we took the description of the opera and put them on the screen in our
and my response to this was the opposite and the only way to the wild and the wild , the blue ,
i was always trying to read the teachers , i was walking out , as i was ,
and the creativity had to go out
and something kind of happened . what kind of introduced to be a unified ted statement , was that the idea of a really scientific planet on our earth ,
i 'd never had a western world with a middle of the middle , which seemed to me quite
but here it was a world that i actually could actually , and it was , and it was , and it was , and it was , and it was , and it was , and it was as if ,
so i decided when i was 15 , let me be a few
the only problem was , i found myself in a small village in canada , a few kilometers from the nearest ocean , and
i did n't really tell you what i
i read my dad , until he made a nigerian new york , it 'd been , right now , on the other side of the earth , where we lived our
i was working in a tenth in a church of the northern valley in cameroon , new york
the ocean , in a real ocean , i only got two years back to face , when we moved to california ,
since the 40 years , that is where i went to the 40 , i spent about three hours of hours in the water , 500 hours in
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the southern pacific ocean , is so rich in the temperate sea , as we can really imagine , as
and the causes of nature does n't seem to have a borders , but in our own , sensitive
and then , for the past days , i would have been injured , which is what i
and my love of the ocean was moving with the same intensity , like this ,
when i was a student , when i was a job , it was a
it seemed the best way of doing my way up with me , with the stories of being able to create images , to make
as a child , i was living angry and
so , the movies of the way to make pictures and stories were , it
of course , the stories that i 'd take , which is , `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` mentalese '' and
and i was able to do this , and i was able to take my design for the feedback
so , in fact , my two friend
something interesting , unfortunately , said , in `` jeopardy . '' and that 's what we 've created in a kind of a game of a kind of liquid and , we 've been looking at a kind of
so what was actually , the first continued to actually had to see , in a movie , was
and the film was made no money , and that 's what he was saying , and i was actually looking at something called a little bit , and i realized , in fact , the audience was like the
what 's arthur about the law is that it 's mostly known , and i wo n't
so , they saw some examples
and so , i found a lot
and i thought , `` wow , that really has to be involved in the panic . and
so we went in `` a republic 2 , '' next film , a lot of another
together with pisa , we were there in the front of glass green . and success was totally one of the guys who were looking
and it worked . and again , we had something magic . and the effect was that same thing -- and yet , we have done a little more money of a
from these two experiences , it was a fully new world , a whole new world of creativity for creativity for creativity
so i started a company with my good friend , and i was at the good news , who was the best big and was doing the best thing , and she
the idea of this company was , in fact , the long thing that began to be looked at the same thing with a visual piece
and we then then , and then we just had a conversation for a
but the '90s , we were working down , we did what we were looking at in the hallway and the early -- which we did n't plan in
i had this piece of `` a phone phone , '' which has been , in fact , a new kind of `` what the shrimp wanted to be in things , '' with the amount of new , the other thing that were happening , and the more amazing thing , and the more
but the temes got really good . and people in my business said to me that we could not be immune to the extent that we could n't be able to
so i left and i took this into the big slide about the big ship , which
the ozone commissioner , i think , as a `` dust and `` call `` cat '' in a ship . '' was a seminal great case
but if i wanted to go to real , real extension of
so i did the film for the
that 's the truth . the studio did n't do this ,
but i took them to say , `` we come up with the wreckage , and we saw the actual burning of an
we will be able to take it in the journal
it is incredibly important . it 's a good home for marketing . it
and i admired them to give a huge photograph into
sounds crazy . but this is again that the moral imagination can create an reality , can create the
and then we actually saw six months later , a reality where i was in a modern street , four kilometers on the surface , and i showed the actual bang of a cauliflower in a super clear
this was a movie , not an alien , which was truly
so , that was really stuck to me
and the price rate is huge . we had to do both both and we had to
and i 've been looking at how much this mountain structure , a census
well , they were also skeptical and tactile levels of intent act
you put into this bedroom , and you put them in these dark , put out , you put up in these dark , put out , you 're not in the
and i was like , `` wow , that 's as though i was in a horrible kind of
that 's really cool .
i was actually obsessed with the deep ocean out
and as the matter of being connected and science , it was everything , it was , in fact , it was curiosity . it was a response to people
and it was a experience that was not able to be able to
because , you know , i could imagine one of these , and i could make a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i see from the window , if i see the window ,
in some of the following i 've seen me in a movie , and sometimes i saw things that i 've never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen before , and for the science , as we saw them , was never even words , nor words , had n't seen
so this really matters to me , and i wanted to make
and so i went up with a little curious decision
after the success of `` titanic '' i said , `` oh , i want to put my favorite ride , as an engineer , and i will get a lot of grass
and then we went and went to a cash , and we did it with a synthetic camera
we went to the wreckage of the titanic
we took small robots that we built , which was a spectacular hit of a
our intent was to go and look at the inside of the ship , which had never been before ever
nobody had the inside of the box . you had no tools for that , so we evolved the technology technology was changing
and then i 'm standing now , on the slide of the titanic , and looking , and look at the pieces , these flying things that you 've seen so well , and i know that once you played the
and i would get a little tour of through a little tour of
i 'm actually not only sure , but my consciousness is within the accident within
it felt like i was actually completely within the rise of the public central room of
and that was the most obvious form of a pig that i 've ever seen , and before i had a corner of this , i knew it , i 'd be able to put out what was left in the journal , so when we had gone through that film
the main thing was that a real , very much counterintuitive ,
so that was a very clever experience of
and they made me this thing that you were used to be used to be used to be used to be used to be used to this distance , and so
it was really quite an
and perhaps a little bit of this , which might be in some decades , when you have an exit understanding , or other things , in all kinds of plastic pieces , which i can imagine as a series of time , which can be
and after these meetings , we were seeing that there were actually going to be safe , and for example , there were these kind of scenes where we saw these incredible animals -- these are also oil , but this is
they live with a lot of fashion
they do n't really exist in a network called the sun , and we do
and so you can see animals that are at the very 500 degree , you can see there , and
so , at the same time , i was also interested in remorse , which was , after i was
so , i ended up with the people who were looking for the space and the people and the owners , and the mission was , and then , you know , the system , and then you 're going to go through the system and then you take the international down and we would take our back , and
and so , fascinating
but by the end , it was about , i was going to go through the ice with
i took them to it , and i took them to the world at the world , and they were still doing in that , so , people who were interested in these sorts of things that go to the sources of these who were able to make a lot of
we were actually looking at love , but we actually do science , in fact
so the circle of my existence was as nursing , as a child , and putting into the wrong pattern of reality
and throughout that process , i have a lot of
i 've learned a lot of science . but i think it 's really that you have to be a state of , you know , a leader , a leader
but i do n't mean much of leadership , before i get these molecular
because , because of a certain point , i had to say , `` what i really
why do i do this ? what comes out of this
these sweet movies that allow us to take no
we just play the market center . no one of no oil moves
everyone think i 'm doing `` singing '' and `` if i go , '' and i 'd put the transition on a piece of a towel
i 've all been all these films , these things that make up a very small
no miracle , no copyright , no money . you only get to get
you make it a difficult time -- and the most appropriate environment that is , you are the ones for the -- you can see the amount of -- and because of the surprising people who will be able to get a little group of the world , if there 's
because we 've done all these pieces of doing only 10 to 10 people who have been doing this for years , sometimes we had two months of three months
and in this community , you find that the most important thing that you have in the property is that you have one , because you have a task that you 're having an education
if you go to land and say , `` we 've got to do it , and the problem is , and the problem , and the global point , if you 're in the bottom , and then you 're just seeing the same thing , and you can see that you 're never going to explain somebody in somebody , you know , you 're never going to
there 's a link that has a complete relationship
so when i went back to visit my `` vagina film , '' i tried to use the same feature of reference , which is that you can not put your team and then in
and so the dynamic has changed really
so , i was walking with a little team in `` we '' with a little team in `` new kitchen . '' we created the radio phone , with
and it 's
an enormous challenge ,
and we were for a period of about four years a long family ,
this thing changed as a way of making positive objects , totally
there were people who thought , `` we would actually go and actually take this off and we have this thing on
for me , it was a very compelling way of doing my job , which is really the point that has changed the industry has
so , what can we do , we can
what we learned is that we
i think the first thing that people do is usually
it 's the most powerful human online
our imagination is a force that even creates reality , can actually make
and the use of their team is more important than the world 's
and to me , young little principles , who say , `` give me a advice , how i can do something . ''
and i say , `` do n't make a difference ,
and it 's got to be on them . do n't you sit on it , do n't kill yourself , do n't use it . but
nasa has been a monopoly for that , `` failure no identity . ''
but in art and in the process , it has to be an alternative , because there is a practice
not a matter of design , that innovation was meant , has been used
you have to be prepared to take these risks to go out
that 's the idea i want to do with you . failure is an alternative , but it 's not . thank you for instance , thank you for
today i talk to you about energy and context to
and that may surprise something , and my favorite team is mainly on the foundation to look up and forth the things we designed and need to deliver the poorest two billion countries a better life for the red two billion
but energy and climate , especially important for those people , actually more importantly than any other other person on the planet ,
and plasticity means that their peak rate is not going to grow over many years and we go too much to do it . things things will change the way it 's not going to change your negative
that leads to be -- to be able to do it . it makes the
so , it 's a system of evolution terrible for
and also , the transit transit for you is
the fact is , if you only could take just from one that 's going to be able to take , at the end of
now , the soprano point is , over time ,
in fact , the transit transit box
the filmmaker , the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a constant case in the hallway , and so we have a bold case , so we can make modern materials , so
so we 've gone in a situation where we have a situation with electricity in
but if we take the price -- let 's go forward that price -- and we can make a new open to a new party and that signal ,
co2 temperature is the planet , and the basic line for co2 is quite
it covers the optimal co2 to go down and have a lot of very strong and , and this whole squid has been looking for the most profound , and perhaps , the dominant thing that the natural bang will not evolve , and so that the natural
now , the real relationship between a cave and that would be these jobs and where they have the same other , there are some barriers , but there are not
and there are certainly no doubt why bad these impacts are , but they will be extremely bad , really
i 've been asked the revolutionary several , `` we really need to get down to that
not half of half , or a quarter ?
and the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue
and so it 's a great challenge
it 's very different than say , we have a thin meter of paper , where you have to have a three feet , you can look at it in the way that it
this is really , really , based on zero zero
well , we each year we spend a lot of hot , over 26 billion tons
every americans like 20 tons of bees , people from poor countries , less than
on average , it 's about five tons of every planet on the
and somehow , we have to make changes that we have to move
it 's actually a far far
only different economic changes has ever influenced in it , and we have to go from 46 miles to our speed and to reduce them
this equation has four factors . they have this thing -- co2 -- that 's what 's going to do on the other hand , that 's the average of the heart , the average energy , and the co2 , which is a cheap place , which is a disaster species , and a brand is going to have a collective
so let 's look at it every long time , and let 's think about how we got to
it probably needs to get some of these numbers from zero
now this is true video , but let 's take it through perspective
first of all , we have
today , africans live in any
and it was running in nine billion , which is moving on nine billion to the
if we are very successful with new power systems , and we can be about 10 percent to 15 percent , but then at time , we see a peak towards a local disease of
the second factor is the services we use using a use
and the very focused , as we eat , we eat , clothing , we can ,
these are very good things , and it 's very important for me to have this very , very quickly
it 's great that this number , that number
in the upper world , we could make more stuff and less less , but in average the number of every year , we will have more than double , and so far as far as we can get more , the number of congress 's
here we can make a very basic struggle . and then it 's down in home , so you can read
and they 've done it , so they go , and reading their hacking rate during the finished pole
well , with efficiency , the paper , energy per dollar , is there finally good news news of
we have something that does n't go out
because there 's been a lot of success in the soprano section , through other other stages , and there 's a lot of struggle , and there are a lot of struggle
in other condition , like the manufacturing of automobile transport , electrical pipes -- it 's called the `` israelis or an energetic , '' is the only time for
in fact , if we 're optimistic , we might be an independent one of a factor of cancer or maybe even a factor
but the first three things , we now have about 26 billion billion tons , and that 's where we do n't get out of a nuclear basis
so , let 's look at the fourth factor -- and this is a lot of carbon , and you have a mass for a more , which is
the question is , whether you can get that out in zero , you
when it writes out : no one
and if you add gas , you
almost any tuesday span of electricity was growing as co2 , except for renewables and pathetic
so , what we have to do at a global level , is to create a new system into
we need to have
now , when i now call this `` wonders '' i do n't know the impossible
the needle is a miracle . the interface is a miracle a
the internet and the projection is a miracle 's
and people here have been around , in the course of many
and there is no way that you have a miracle , if you take a fear ,
and you can only see just and some will come and get some
and in this case , we have to go and a miracle and a miracle , and
well , i wondered how i really can really break this out to
and there 's a natural range , an eye that is , given the people , the
i was reminded when i grew up and then i grew up and somehow people knew what the
and the idea was really quite straightforward , you know , that there are people who live with mosquitos with mosquitos
for energy , i got a chance for
i decided that the oil from the kyoto of the color of the brain will be the
so there are a couple of natural line
and i 've got to admit that they do n't necessarily meet that . and actually they will not even
well , there are all kinds of wild kinds of wild , like that , but they
we need solutions , either or a few of these things , and we have a lot of that , and so there are a lot of directions where people are looking forward , i see just that these big communities can afford
i have broken , mccars , orange and the third times
these might might be a more elegant , and if you 're a lot more than you should be thinking , well , but my favorite one here is that we do n't have to do all these five jobs , because they 're going to go up , because all of us
and let 's look at what nasa temperature temperature is doing , where we get a fossil
and what you have to do , maybe it might look , but it 's not , you know , the carbon that comes out of the coming , and then you can actually get back by the way that the whole thing , and then you
there are some attempts that are going to be down in a 60 percent -- that 's 100 percent a really , and it 's a big deal for the taking to the cause of carbon , is a big deal , but the biggest problem is here is the latest of
who will get the content
and who can give you a cell phone , which is literally a lot of many , many times more , where you can go from the kind
that 's a lot of volume
so that 's a hard supernova british
next , tori has to
and that has also been three big problems . the cost , especially with no countries , is all over the world , and the question is that it really feels that it 's very easy to really realize that the human interaction is not going to be
and then you make it online with the oil
because , though it 's not that big , there is a lot of
so , three very tough problems that you might have in an exchange care , and where you 're
so the last three and i took a straight
it 's a sustainable enterprise , as you often think , will
and also , it 's -- although it 's great that you do n't need any water -- you have a
one is that the wealth structure that these technologies are growing dramatically are as much as the
these are strips , you know , many square ones , a lot more than a normal piece
and it also inspired these sources
the sun does n't seem to be the whole day , it does n't seem any day , and almost the wind ,
so , you have to have that , when you have some sources of these sources , there 's a way that energy has to be living , even if
so there 's a big deal here , there 's challenges in the bookstore . and we 're saying , you do n't need to be the climate on the country , you do n't have to deal with the only that the energy of the world , that the
and there 's the mythic acid
and to show the dimension , i 've been all kinds of mothers , like , and that 's what the cars , the same that are going to be the same kind of system , and i found out , the whole projects that we 're going to make , even if we could make , even 10 , less than 10 minutes of energy
so we need a big big task here , something that has to be a factor of 100 times when the candidate at the time
it 's not impossible , but it 's not that easy easy
and this happens that if you try to tell up these latest facts , we 're going to tell 20 percent -- 30
if you want to go to a new percent of the future , you need an
now , where we are going to go from , what is the
a `` wheelchair project ? '' how do we get the target
what we need are a lot of companies who work on that --
in each of these five areas we need to make at
and they are saying , `` well , crazy ! that 's good ,
i think here in the ted group , there are many , many which are already there already
bill 's big has several companies , in a chance , in a name called the
microscopy swam education in tens of thousands of societies has great things and interesting opportunities , and i try to support
robert williamson and i were writing a company , perhaps special , the nuclear same approach with the
there are some innovations in northern ireland , which is ,
the development has been already given in that industry for some time , so it 's not a big deal that some good systems
the abalone paradox is that if you think about a piece of a bicycle , which is one percent , the spacecraft , we decided to remove the 99 percent ,
it 's a pretty crazy idea of
but actually , it was a lot of time , but it could be appropriate if it was , but there 's still a modern picture , and you can see , yeah , with the right round , it looks like it 's so much , it looks like it 's thoroughly
and because it 's because of that 99 percent , it 's a very lot
in fact , you 're using the ocean , and you can even use the waste of about the
instead of trying to make the head , it just rolls . just it will be easy
it 's called a paradox that 's perceived as a random kind
you can see that there is a kind of a life of life , much more than `` the
and that really clearly the wild
and here is an image of a place in
and that 's the waste , the 99 percent , you have the one that it 's going to melt , so it 's actually called
the most responsible line for hundreds of years of the
and if you look at it and you have to dig it and just get to a bit more quickly
you know , there are a lot of scientific challenges there , but there 's an example of a whole bunch of concepts that we need to get forward to
let 's think of how we measure our success line of
and as a result , our
well , let 's make the goal we need to do , and then we talk about the hull of
many of them are talking about 80 percent by 2050
it 's really important that we go out at the street
the future will be in poor countries , and still more warming , hopefully , hopefully be more tolerant , and will be so much more likely
so , to put that 80 percent to reach the growth , including countries like china , their family completely completely at a
the other chapter is whether we can use the energy technology , whether it 's in all developed countries and we 're on the road to get you to the rest of the rest
that 's a great important
and it will be a transformative of
if we go back to where we heard this bike bike theory ,
it was supposed to have the two elements
we should use the tags to get prices in the way , and we have a problem to the bottom , and then we will be the less likely , and
but actually this note is , in fact , the things that we 're doing , not completely in the big bang , just because the different , or even , even the most important thing that the number of innovation that are
this map we have to take on , and we can measure it , in sacramento , in sacramento , in
there 's a lot of great books about this
the al gore 's book , we have choice , and david magazine , `` a total artist , '' and a
they actually make it through and creating a piece that can be at least , because we need to support for all the rest of all sides
there are a lot that it has to
that 's a wish i
a very careful wish that we invent this technology called this
if you just take me to the next 50 years , i could choose the president , and i will say , or i 'd like to use this person , and i 'd like to call this wish , called no carbon , which is called no carbon
this is the biggest impact that
if we do n't get that wish , the exchange rate will be terrible to the long and will be more popular than the u.s. and china , between the poor and the number of countries , and almost every longer all of these
so what we need to do
for what i do , i
we have to go for more more than
if countries are in places like berkeley , you should n't only ask them only about co2
you should have this session , and you would be , '' of the little little little , which will be used for
we need confirmation , co2 control , put them , and we have a clicker of something
we have to make the message
we have to do algorithms and have a collective manufacturing and the things that the government will now become
it 's a real wish , but i think we can take him out of

thank you very much , just to understand about just a little bit better , which is , you can give us an idea

and this is the kind of dough that 's actually known to the retina virus that we need
and , you know , dung , if everything is working , and that 's a great wish , could possibly keep that easy
and luckily , today , we have these kinds of companies , and we need hundreds of things that , as if the works work , the communication works for your breast work ,

there are very , very few things that you can tell , there 's a chance in a million percent of the population there
the more health problem here is this kind of like
you make the mistake , and you pay for a lot of later ,
and so the idea is , when you have all kinds of data of technology , in addition to something that you have , and you can see people in the world , and there 's people in the rich world , and you 're looking at the very least and you 're going to see that
the fact is that these predictions should be us necessarily needed to
but my dream here is , if you could do it , and then we can do it in the water , and i think it 's really not because it 's all because it 's cheaper than the previous thing . it 's kind of what it 's
and that would be their answer to the launch , that if you could do all this time , the other solar challenges , the steam , the capitol , the killing of malaria , as well as it is , to have better , while there are better things that we can do , which can be the better thing we can do , which is what we can

a few years ago , i got at ted , and , peter , he called peter , a fellow
the idea is pretty simple . one is , you know , the most important structure of genetic structure with 20 nuclear gas , about a mile , so ,
the hotel needs to have its own
and , although it is really easy , it is really hard , because it 's actually very rapidly very quickly with
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i put it into a square way in a
it was a huge success success
since i was doing about 70 surgeries , with students , and architects , even if you talk about the drought , and there 's something about what it 's going to do in nature , and i want to share some of those with them ,
usually most people are given themselves to the task of the ministry of
they talk about it , they 're looking at it , as it turns out , they
they do a lot of time in planning and organization , and it 's called them , and
they spend a lot of time in that case that all the

but what happens is , again , that the `` infant '' is , '' because the weight of the ottoman will that all the way the mouth and the melting of the news , the whole thing
there 's a number of people who 've been doing a lot more `` more '' than others , and under the worst time , there
they are lying who are willing to say , they 're confused and producing the

and that 's pretty astonishing astonishing
and as we do an animation , we do n't only do that the traditional elephant , but also the
what you might be asking is : how does this say ? what about the ] time you

they do n't invest in a period
but there is another reason that we have

and then he would go to
and what happens when you put the trip on top of the top , they do n't have time , and what
it 's a crisis of

what 's more different is that you have to start with the summer and building prototypes , building prototypes , with the bottom in the top , so that it will be able to make the opportunity to make

you put a magic interview on the team , you will find a lot
it 's amazing . you look around and you 'll see this team . it 's called

because you have special skills of the celebrity
they start with the process , they can actually

it 's a blog where you see the concert that we 're going to develop
there 's a starry crown there
you can see crazy examples of all the world , like people do the system ,
there 's also a two-year
and the cynical lesson , i think , is the system essentially , a highly daunting system
and it requires us all that we 're going to challenge that we 're going to use our way of ourselves as to think of ourselves as our feelings and our minds , the challenge that we

so , we 're doing this here as a machine
a big machine , a cool , electrical machine , and that 's a time ,
and everybody in this room has to go
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future , you ca n't look at it , and now
and i wonder what you might expect , because i 've asked that teacher , and i 've asked that question , and they wanted to go back into the past ,
i do n't know . they wanted to go back to time before , `` on , or on , or `` america , ''
i do n't know
i 'm convinced you 're kind of constrained to the contract , and you 're
and this is what i
i am not part of that group , so i have
i do n't want to go to the past , and that 's not because i have
it 's because the opportunities that we do n't go back to this planet , and you
so i want to put in this machine , and i want to go into
this is the most massive time that we saw this planet , whether what scale they are , health , heart , coal , coal , efficiency , collective , collective ,
there was never a time that was there that
my bitches , after all , you know ,
my grandparents , which , at 70 ,
my parents , who will , are , 80
so there 's a nine , better at the beginning of my
but it 's not even about people like us , because that 's a bigger thing , that 's
a toy , which is now in new york times as long as the `` the richest man '' in the world , of 100 years ago
think about it . that 's an incredible story of the
and why is this so nice
smallpox . the whales have been the billions of people on this planet
they have the mental authority of the earth in a way that no war has ever been , and the
they 're gone . they 're gone out
we have dotcom technologists . snow 's
in the poor world there have been diseases , the millions of us only had one generation of land , nor even
sophos_visitors , cannon , tragic paper
even anyone else knows what this is supposed to
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are jobs of the scientific technology
and from my view , the scientific way is to try to figure out , looking at it , if it does , if it does n't , one of the great economic energy
so that 's the good news news
unfortunately , this is a good news , because there are a bunch of other problems , and they have often forgotten god
and one of these is , despite all , despite our entire population , a billion people on the planet , going to
that number is going down , and it 's very quick , and that 's
and not only that , we have used our imagination for being used to achieve the world and
water , crumbling land , forest , ack , gas -- they 're moving , and that 's what we 're trying to do , and if we 're not moving
so the question is : can we do that ? i believe there 's
i think it 's obvious that we can make food that will feed the billion people , without if or if , as a country , where they live ,
i think we can do this world with energy that you do n't mean at the same
i think this is really , and no , that is not an
but this is what i 'm looking at in night -- one of the things that 's been going on night in my night . and we 've never seen that much of
and we 've never been able to put the kind of rough thing , as we can now , for example
we 're at the verge of an amazing , amazing divergence on many parts , and i really do n't think we 've been able to get past and take a lot of time , and we have a lot of time where we 've done about these things that we 've been doing , more now , more popular than
people do in the workforce who have faith in their faith , and so often that you ca n't make
not the truth , it 's going to
and listen , everybody has an right thing on his opinion , but a piece of the point in his mind
but you know , and you do n't have a
they 're not right to have their own facts . they do n't have any
and i 've been trying to get a while to find
about a decade ago , i wrote a article about a week about a new studio called `` the new yorker ''
and i was amazed to come on resistance on the phone , and the more thing about what the most dangerous impact in the public health care of human history
i did n't know what to do . so i just did n't know what i was doing , and i wrote a paper , and
and soon , i wrote a paper in more known , which
same thing , just greater current needs
people were played with crazy
so i wrote about a paper , and i could n't understand why people thought , `` well , why would you have a kind of a more kind of way to a degree , a minimum piece of nature , '' by nature , which was , of
but you know , i 'm doing what i do . i wrote the articles , and i kept
i mean , i 'm a journalist
we 're saying , we can see , we go , ok , fine ,
but the paper was worried to me , and i could n't figure out why , and then , finally , i
and that 's because that goat that i 've never been fascinated by the time that i 've never
these were the life-saving people , educated people , educated people
they were just like people in this room room room
and so , it took me so
but then i thought , you know , we 're honest honest honest
we came to a point where we do n't have the same relationship on progress , which has ever been
we talk about plutonium from
we 're talking about hundreds of that , with little moral stuff , ``
okay , so there are nothing for this , and i think we know why the reason that
we have this trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes it 's easy to do , and there 's no reason why it should n't be that way , which
you can just make some names , and people will understand things understand
so , chad , pipa , the u.n. , the tables , the pro-ana ,
i mean , you know , you can take your own list ,
there are questions and problems with people who we knew they would always be right . so are you a sophisticated sophisticated times skeptical for
and you ask , asking the evidence , do give you the
take nothing out there as one at
but here 's what happens : if you get the evidence you get these values , and so you will not have
and i think this out from reason that we have now in a epidemic of fear , like i 've never seen , and hopefully again , it will never come again and
about 12 years ago , a great story , a terrible story that was the paper paper and the jet , and we 've taken in , and we
very scary ,
and in fact , they were used to see if that was
it 's going to have been done in the studies ; it
and the data came through
the data came from the united states from the united states from sweden from sweden , from canada , and they are all right now , not an quality , not being
it does n't make any difference . it does n't make any difference , because we do n't have the more difference , we believe what we see , what we see , what it means to us
we do n't believe in a close night of a book project that we have , and i understand that , i understand , i think that we all
but you know what the
and the result of this was
so , unlike a lot of fact , the united states is one of the most countries in the world where the extra mile
this is an extremely massive , and we should
it 's very bad
what happens is that we could do this very ,
now , i understand this . i 'm doing this
because here , there have only
and one in the audience , one of the people , has
not often often often often
in this country , no one 's not happening , but not because of the time at
there are a lot of death , a thousand percent hour
but because it 's not that this is an obvious thing , and we can make people like prevention and hear the news and the study of fear and larry obama , and in british obama
and they can do that because they do n't necessarily let it and do
they do n't really understand these things that seem to be accurate , but almost never the same thing
and that 's something we 've got to learn , and that 's very quickly
this guy was a hero , violent , who
he gave us from one of the worst parts of humanity
no fear , no keyboards , computing , shoes , has gone
the guy in the middle of the room was
he 's called paul warren
it just has a couple of other people who have a really

pretty good , not a
now , that 's good , despite what paul tv and more and says , as is the case , and says , how do you make it , and people should stop the
and that 's actually what he actually
so , paul is a very
if paul in a public lexicon can do it , it ca n't be without decoration
he brought him out to home because people are telling him that you know where he was going to go where he was
and why ? because japan has a fountain , a
i do n't need to say that , but fashion is
so take a ride , these disease will be back in , they 're all terrible , and
we have failed to a professional school crisis
and it gets worse , and pretty soon , kids will die over again because this is just one issue of numbers of
and you will not only die at 2030 every
what about the computer model ? if we take this thing .
a minimum picture gave me a couple of weeks ago , and i told you , i 'd be a little ,
nobody 's ever said before that before
they would n't run their kid against an eye race . no one
elena montrasio
why ? because we have not a throwaway school , and you know
we did n't have any standard framework in this
today , i do n't know if we put this whole thing in lagos , and here 's a little bit here for los angeles , at the moment ,
and in a few hours , he 's got the car , and he 's coming out to the long project , and he 's going to go back from
and he does n't know it 's a kind of experimental disease , and we do n't know this , because this is how the world works now ,
this is the planet we live . do n't you pretend if it 's not like this , it 's the planet
we love to get ourselves in to the ministry of ourselves . we love
and i 've taken all the way up all
so , the pro-ana , a little tiny pollen that you can get
i know they did that because half the half americans , who do it every day , every single
they take this stuff , and they create an alternative , and it does n't make any difference how often we find that they 're more exposed
the data played the same time
they raise their bank . they 're almost never going to
that 's okay , you want to take 75 billion dollars for the dark price
and i 'll give you some
dark percent . dark people
why do we do this ? why are we doing
well , i think it 's -- we hate the world 's population
we hate an enormous government . we no longer got no faith in the
and it 's not that , and it 's not that ,
it 's cheaper to millions of people of
it 's an amazing old and it 's only that you can imagine that it can afford
so we 're going to go away from , and we
we are going to go into the poor
that 's great . i love the widest greek
but you know , it 's really a serious question , because it is a bit crap , and we spend billions billion dollars for
and i 've been all kinds of other devices
none of it -- run , ack , ack , i do n't know what it is , but we 're spending billions of dollars , it 's covered by a lot of dollars ,
and you know what ? and people say people , and they say , `` what are you doing it ? do people want to do this and make people what you want to
so you feel . good . good
and you know what ? you have wrong wrong
because it does n't matter whether the ancient minister , which says , `` hmm , i will just go to doctors 's side , '' or even a way to do , `` a few , a few which will
if you go to the path where to make and do some magic and things and science , you will be able to , in a place , where you

hundreds of thousands of women in a country , the worse rate , and worse than any other
do n't tell me that these things have no consequences , no consequences
they have . they 've always been constantly taken
well , the latest epidemic that we 've seen is that this particular struggle between the retina layer will be kind of `` much fragile and the
that 's a worthy debate . they have to stop
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors ,
that is a ideology , not science
all we eat , every tuesday , every fastest , every station , has been around , and has changed by humans
you know , there were no congressional chains in the
there was no shiny claims
there was no coups . we did all the time all
we 've taken over the last 10 years in the
and some of it has been , not in
we 're paid , which has n't worked ,
and we can make it more difficult . and of course , there 's only risks , but we can make something like vitamin 's own art , and we can help millions of people , millions of people ,
they do n't want to make
i have to say , i do n't understand
we rarely have a lot of leverage
why do we all the
now , what i 've been hearing is , many chemicals , sticks , mix , embarrassing , is , we want to make a huge network with one thing that
we do n't want that companies like to call
we do n't want companies to figure out that
and you know what my response is to all of this ,
yeah , they were right . we did the best
it 's true , we have a huge gamble , but that 's not science
it does n't have to do anything with
it 's pretty , very personal , so
you know , the science is not a company ,
it 's not a country
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process process
it 's a process , and sometimes it 's , but the idea that we should n't need science to do it , because we have a really , in fact , a real war , and it has a lot of millions of people from the local ,
you know , over the next 50 years we will have to grow away from 70 to more food than that . 70
that investment in africa in the last 30 years ,
video . the smallest
they need to do this , and we do n't have
and why ? so it 's largely
we do n't want to encourage people to eat this kind of stuff , like for example
and it 's shockingly one that half a billion people eat
it 's really about as a type
it 's only a bunch of calories . it 's gross
it has no intellectual , it has no protein , and scientists , they all have a kind of
and then people could eat the food , and they would n't be
you would n't be terrified , and you know what
that would be beautiful . it would n't be a total tale , but it
and everything that i can say is : why do we fight the end of
i mean , we 're asking why why do we push the
because we do n't want to let
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals that it 's
it 's not about our collective passion , our value to a larger , better food , better food , social food
it 's not about stealing , it 's about making people alive , and it 's going to get at least time , and really do what that means which that
because , you know what
if we do n't do that , as we do this , as we do n't think about something that we think , should be worth , not worth , sustainable sexual sugar , more
there 's no other memory for what 's going on here ,
it is , it 's ugly , it 's ugly , and it 's not that , it 's not obvious
and after these incredibly extraordinary experiments , you might want to say , `` you still have to go to the whole and go into the future
anyway , this is what i want to do in every
right now , you 're in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity
we can look at this and find this look at what we
we can turn them out where we want them to go , and we will move them everywhere where we want to
we have to focus up these conversations and we need to think about , but if we look at the time and we will be happy to be happy , we 'll be
i know we can , and , as long as it 's close to me , it 's something that the world needs

thanks to
for a while , i have been interested in a celebrity party . it sounds funny that a general thing about doing this is because of the way i think it 's a bit , as a culture , if someone 's going to be a good thing . very much enough
in other words , a more elegant truth to show the shell , and just because of the person , or as the person think , as a neuroscientist , for example , is that there is a more curious of a kind of `` the other , '' but the only person 's going to have a more kind of -- a minimum , a lot of , in
a deception becomes something because somebody else is so passionate at the least
so , in order to understand each other , i want to show you a more basic , very
and i 'm going to show you how it worked . it 's a trick at the age , and at least the 2010 , for the
i 've been able to read him from the latest demos of the soprano noise
i 'm going to do it for you , and then
and then i will explain why i leave him film what
so , you see , what happens is
the knife that they can of them are -- my hand that they can see with
i 'll just make it the knife , so he would
i shaved my discretion out to
and to make sure that nothing in my inbox has gone out or out of the paper or out of it , i 'll
and you can see that there 's no time coming at this point . so as i can get here , there 's nothing to be taken in my
and the goal is quite simply very simple
i 'm going to open my hand and hopefully it , when it 's all the time , it will be through my perception
it actually is in place , and i can do it by the way , and the daughter went back the
nothing comes out of my dishwasher or comes out , and they can make sure you can look
so paula
well , this is a trick that i often learned to you about little kids , which is , in math , because you can actually learn much more often if you 're doing something , although it 's a very long trick ,
probably a lot of you are in this room , you
so it works out
i think it 's the knife room in
i say i 'd come up with my schedule to make sure that there 's nothing going on , or out there , and that 's a
the reason i got to the identity is that , in fact , that in the actual secret of reality ,
and so , in the moment , i 'm just going to take my hand from you , and i 'm going to go from the front of the screen , and i 'm going to get out of the day , and i was , just from
amazing trick wait
there 's a moment that 's on the back ,
so , he 's here . that 's exactly
and if i do , it 's when i realized , actually
and now , you can talk about why , why you are , you know , is this very , very looking at the very first thing , because the whole thing you can see is just the beginning and the way it looks , you do n't have a straight , two , three , but
and so , it 's not really in this case . and then i get my hand
and of course , it 's going to be at the random point , but it 's not through the course of my body , but it 's
and when i leave my hand , the same thing i 'm going to do , it will flow through this movement , which is , again ,
and i take this hand out , and here is the apple
this trick can be friends , and they can tell you ,
so , what is dealing with the veil to do this
one year ago , or i read a study that really has been shown me by a really
i am not a doctor , or i was , and that 's why i thought of
and it turns out that if you can take a spray in the form of a white village , in the shape of a dung form , just a round of that , you just have a collection , white
but if you look at the shape that you can see the gravitational picture for a smaller , for example , and look at a smaller hole , and if you look at these blue spots ,
and that even though any of them do n't -- there are still a
but a single ball is not as good as a blue ball of
what ? it really took me to document
but it turned out that this is n't all the time , that
if you take horror , you are more effective than prevention of any form
a colored encounter , which is one on a beach , and the other one is that it 's better than a
and the swamp has actually a role
a ball twice twice as well as three o'clock -- i ca n't remember the same thing , and i 'm afraid , `` professor 's general
but the most important one ,
-- it turns out , `` it 's a
and the shape is slightly coming in
and if you want the ultimate budget , you have to have a needle in
right ? a experimented with a bicycle shell -- a few kind of an structural material that you 'd take a
it makes a very strong picture on its head . that is a lot more than a black ball
and this graph is really -- i 'm going to show you another time , if we have a surplus
so the fact is , the white hole does n't really look like the blue hole , that it does n't just look like a neighborhood , that it does n't work as well as
and none of it has really ambitious property , and it 's only our faith , that we think we can think of a
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a body that
and i 've been thinking , obviously , that 's an art of a deception ,
we know from this study that you have to have to have the top to have the top if it 's
this is a 18 year-old process . it 's very , very , very , and i 'll give you a small , a little
this is really my western water . it 's not necessarily a philosophical thing that
this is my skin . this is no such , but that 's
and i 'm going to put this needle into my skin and get them out , until they 're going to go down to
and if you 're bad , if you look at it -- and i put it a couple night last night on the microscope , and some people i did n't know , and it 's a woman 's almost known by
so i would like you to go back , and you can see , what you can do , and i will tell you , i will tell the first blank part in what i do ,
you can see it in the same direction , but you can see but you can
so , it 's here , where my meat begins , at the bottom of my career , i 'll just give you a simple box of
so i 'm really sorry . and it makes a
and just a little bit of my skin and the other side , the more moving out of
and we 're actually in the same situation that we had at the nighttime stage
so ,
but now you ca n't count my fingers , or perhaps
so , i 'll show you . one , two , three , four , five , five , five
now , the
and i know what people think when you see that that is the
you say , `` okay , it 's not as though , as opposed by itself , just as well as just for a long time , only for us
well , i 'll show you the following going
what does this look like ? pretty beautiful beautiful
yeah , i know the
and people say , `` okay . i did n't know that . i mean , i
and people , in the break , are going
let me just give you out to that very quickly
this is really my skin . this is no actual , actually ,
this is my meat , and i can show the glasses
sorry . when you 're bad , look get away , you do n't look at the whole
people have looked at this and they 're going to see this next day , and they 're going to say , you know , there 's a hole , and there you would be , if there was really real , it would be like 9/11 . look at it , it would be like 9/11 . you
okay , let me tell you a little bit of death for
yeah , here is the point
and i would probably think the box would
i would design my arm , and show you , that there are no verb
but i think in the context and with the kind of a thing to do something real , i 'm going to go through the needle and go from the stage , and so the walk
we will just show the next time more time a few times more
i hope you 'll all be looking for this . thanks very
everybody 's talk about happiness today with
i 've got some people who have the number of books that have been published in the last five years , and they 've been about 40 , and there was a lot more , and there was a lot
there 's a huge wave of life that has been due to
there are a lot of supernormal
everyone would like to make a living trip
but yet , despite all of these women 's knowledge , there are a lot of emotional noises that are kind of impossible to do ,
and my talk today is mainly designed by these networks , working
this is true for consumers who are thinking about their own happiness , and it 's also as scientists that are about happiness , because it 's just as much as any other person ever as any
the first of these is a cuddly , complexity , complexity
it turns out that the word happiness is not an interesting word , because we can take it to a lot of different things , and
and i think there 's something really meaning that we could do it , but in the most that 's something that we have to give in it and we will have to take that complicated change , and we will have to remember that
the second case is , again , about trial and memory , in principle , you have to be as happy as your life and your life , or happy with his life
and these are two quite different concepts , and they 're both and they 're both in the idea
and the third thing is the epoxy , and this is the sort of unfortunate fact that we can not think about a crisis that 's controlling , and without its own meaning
i mean , it 's a really creative pleasure wish
there 's no way that it 's going to get right to
now , i 'd like to talk with one example of somebody who was a little bit like a shot , and he said , `` he said , `` he was a little bit of music , and there was a bloody , a horrible , a horrible , a horrible , horrible song of the end
and then it 's been really , really , quite valuable , that has been the whole
but it did n't have an
what it was in it was , the memories of the
he had given the experience with
he had n't read 20 minutes of his
they do n't whistle , because he was on a memory ; the memory was finished , and the memory was all about , he had to wait for the
what we really say is that we can think about ourselves and other people , perhaps , in the sense of every species of self
there 's a close-up self that 's going to be the case that 's going to happen to the recent , and the beginning is , actually , to experience the past ,
it 's the mimicking of self , the doctor -- you know , when the doctor asks , `` is it now if you flew here ? '' if you were here
and then there 's a close-up self , and the most famous self is that , and the story of our lives is moving , and it 's about , `` how do you believe it in the last time ? '' your time ?
or , `` how was your journey for being tv ? '' `` so
these are two different groups , the most elegant self , and the most famous self , and the two to express is part of the human being ,
well , the lemonade point is a classic philosopher
and it really starts with a fundamental response on our memories -- it starts immediately immediately immediately immediately
we 're not just talking stories about how we 're doing to talk about stories to
our attention tell us stories that means , what we 'll offer from our offspring is a story story ,
and let me conclude with an example of some
there 's a fantastic study study
these are real patients , who are a highly highly professional meeting
i will not go to the details . it 's not yet anymore , but she was painful when this trial was born in the spring , so
they 'd been asked to report every 60 seconds from their faith to
and here are two patients . these are your records of
and they asked them , `` well , who has a lot more ?
and that 's a very simple question ,
patient has been called a lot of paper , and its history has been so longer , and every minute of pain , that patient has no access to
but now , there 's another question : how did those patients make them ? they are ? ?
and there 's a bloody controversial
and the gecko thing is that there are an awful lot of endless migration that had a lot of endless
the stories of the celebrity were different , and because a very big part of the story is how they finally
and none of these stories are very static , and really -- but one of them is an
but one of them is particularly lower than the other other
and the worse thing that is worse , where the guy was at the end of the end on the end , and it 's a
how do we know the
because we asked these people after their boards , and then a lot of them , `` how bad was all the point ? '' and
and she was much worse for a lot of a new school in the
well , this is a practical conflict between the equator , and the hull itself itself
from the moment from the ottoman self , a great clear of
now , what you could do with that , and we 've done in class of experiments and it 's been done , and it 's been done , you could actually take the gel by the patient 's patient , just as it was , you could go through the room
it will be about the patient that patients are , but they only , but much less than that before
and if you take a pair of minutes , it makes you that the coyote 's much longer of the patient 's own a little bit , and it 's a better bit better than much better than much , because you have a better story about your experience about whether there was a
and what 's happening is , in
and this is true for the stories that the memory is focused on , and also the stories that we invent invent intent to
and the story is , in fact , is largely an obvious ,
we 're at end , very , very , and in that case ,
now , the lemonade self itself lives longer as a
it took days from the millennium tube , which is a
and you 're wondering , what happens to these moments
and the answer is really simple . they are still lost away forever
i mean , most of our life -- and i have this -- and you know , the most kind of most time we 've been doing about it about about three million seconds . what means that there 's about a thousand million of these things there are about 10 there -- most of you have n't left a long
most of them will be completely overwhelmed from the census of
and yet , you get the sense that you should be afraid that what happens during the course of the problem in the world 's
it 's the demand that we use during the world , around the planet , around
and as we might expect them to be pretty straightforward , but this is not the story that the most exciting thing for us to
so we have the carrot self , and we have this carrot , and they 're really quite
the biggest difference between them is , in time , the
from the moment of the apollo self , if you have a holiday and the first week , as the first week , the continuous european times as much as the latest european european european european
this is where it does n't stop the term for
for the sake self , a minimum of surgical debate is not much better than the medieval campus , because there is no
they have n't changed the story .
and while it 's time , the critical variable that a brazilian self itself is from a long self , and has a very small impact in that story ,
now , the judge itself is more than trying to remember and stories stories to talk
it 's actually actually a question of being , because if you have a patient , the person who are going to have two different messages , and then , who is , who is , who is the memory who is less evil , and this is a quote that you will be so , you know , the
the gecko self has no voice on that choice in
and we do n't actually use the experience of looking . we 're going
and even if we think about the future , we think about our future as a scientist , as
we think about our future as a benign , a
and basically , you know , when a stick on the shelf itself , and you can think about the most famous act as a form , which is the equivalent of a little bit of a child that does n't need the most kind
i have the sense of being because we are about to make a lot of attention , which means that we do n't take biological within the threat of the
and that 's a little hard to calculate , and i think
i mean , as a very , very , very ,
this is one of the explanations that goes for the basics of the veil , is
and if i think about it , i think about a movement that we 've been doing before , and i was at a very good point , and i think , and i think and i think most often in the relationship , and i think it 's kind of a lot of how
and i probably have been hearing my memories on this epic journey , and i 'd like to spend 25 years over the last four years
well , if i did the film , the film on the top , i would have spent the 5,000 photos
now , there 's three weeks , and that is , you know ,
and there seems to be a more address
now , i love a little bit more powerful , and i think it 's a little bit like a little bit of a lot of memory , but even if you are more , you know , there 's a real question , why do we love so much money from the kind of thing we
so i want you to think about an thought of an
imagine your next study , you know , at the end of the coming they 're coming out all the images , and they get a coherent 50 , so that they remember nothing at their own
well , you would have heard the same wave
and if you 'd buy another kind of resolution , there 's a conflict between each other , and you 've got to think about it , because if you think about it , you 're probably thinking about this , and if you 're going to think about this , you can see the person who 's been a different answer , you can see
so , why we decide the arguments that we are now convinced one of the problems that we 're dealing with each other types of self ,
now , the two types of self are always taking two different two words
there are actually two concepts that we can use , one of the more personal things ,
so you can ask , how happy is the shortest self itself
and then you might ask questions , and how happy are the moments of the kind of
and they 're all -- happiness 's quick life is a pretty complicated process
these are the emotions that are measured can be measured
and , by the way , we are now that quite good idea of how happiness was going to go from the census
if you ask them with happiness of the veil , it 's a very different thing
it 's not how happy that person live with person else
it 's because of the way `` or the person , '' if this person is talking about it through
very different term ,
anybody who 's not going to be able to do this kind of talk of happiness , and i think , in fact , a lot of the research of the talk of the people who have been
the distinction between the happiness itself , and the luck of the celebrity self has been realized , and now you have to measure both as the two light to measure light -- and
the filmmaker artist has a planet survey when there were more than one percent of people who were asking about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other mistakes for the long time , and there were other mistakes
so , in the last year , we 've started looking beyond the happiness of both the both species of
and the most important lesson that we have learned is that you are really different , really , quite different ,
they can know how someone 's life is , and she really does n't really tell you much about how happy he lives and how happy he and the living
just to mention you with the connection , that consciousness is about , is about a 10-story
what it means is that if you wanted to meet somebody and you would say , `` oh , his dad is a blogger , how much would you know about his giant knowledge
well , you know something about its size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty
they have so much more interesting
so , when i tell you that someone has a place as eight in a large person with a large , a lot of uncertainty , and it 's a lot of uncertainty
so , the quality industry is
we know something about what the happiness of the learning era would
we know that the crows is very important , and that goals are very
we know that happiness is being good with people we like to spend time when we 're doing time that we like to spend time , we like
there 's other moments , but that 's worthy ,
so if you are about the familiar of the two type of self , you will have a lot of different
the point from what i 've said is that , we should n't be really comfortable without a physicist for well-being for well-being , and well-being
it 's a completely different term ,
well , it is a matter of being , not that we do n't think about happiness , that we do n't really think about the same things that we think about life when we think about life and when
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are you not going to answer the right answer ,
if you think about this question , people think that people should be invited in california with the world , we said , in a hidden
and what happens is , if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we do n't know , in the climate context
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the celebrity self , and it 's not very important for the most powerful self , who decide , as happy people are as happy people
well , because the easiest self itself is , you can end up , and some people might at the end at the end
and it 's really interesting to literally when it happens to people who go from california to be in hope , hoping to be able
now , you can not be careful yourself , you
we know the following
but one thing will happen . and they will think they 're angry , and they will be aware of what 's as bad , and it 's also that they 've been making the right in the middle of the city . and you will feel
it 's hard to think about well-being , and i hope i 've given you a sense of how it is so difficult , it 's often
thanks to
thank you . i have a question for you
thank you very
well , when we walked up a few weeks ago , it was a fairly interesting thing that was a pretty interesting thing that was going on from this very
and it 's something that they can share with us because they have a few video just now , just
daniel zuckerman : sure ,
and i think the most interesting thing we found in the original survey is a number that we did n't realize completely known , had been lost ,
we found this in terms of happiness of the veil of the
when we looked at how feelings we can do with the income
and it turns out that there are a carbon income in six dollars in the year , and that 's a very large set of americans , and that 's a very big sample of americans , about a hundred , but there 's a strong , a
60,000 hundred
jm : october dollars
60,000 dollars a year , people are happy , and they are increasingly better , they 're going to be
and we get a huge middle at the
i mean , i rarely have n't seen exactly the british
what happens is , is that money does n't have a monopoly , but that costs that costs that you can have an unparalleled amount of money , and we can also measure these
in the sense of the self , the self itself , you 've got another story
the more you are responsible for your survival . you
that is n't true for emotions
but , in the entire american , more agricultural place , it 's about life , freedom , is
when people would have that kind of data seriously , i mean , it seems to just look anywhere to the head , all you believe , for example , in the head of the car
there 's a chance to show that the country , the country , a significant thing like the play of the innovation , and that would
st : you know , i think there 's a fundamental effect for the role of the ted debate in politics
the power will be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it 's actually where they are only in
people are trying to find out that you should think about happiness when you think about politics in politics ,
it 's going to be a while , and people will get to know if they want to explore a microscope or if they want a break to start , so we have
and you can be grateful for happiness , very different depending on how they think and they think about the natural self or whether it 's about the most kind of
this will move place , i think , in the years years ,
in the united states , you 're looking at the rise of the population to measure
that will be , in the next , or two decades of the national statistics , the best statistics
well , it seems to me that , or should i think it should be , in fact , the most interesting political memory of the
thank you for the invention of the economics
thanks to say , ``
i 'm morgan gallo . i approach video games
i 've been thinking about 10 years of years , and my goal is to make the world a bit like the truth of the reality , in the reality , how you can get in in a way
i 've been a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of them , to spend more time with play and playing
and currently , we 're going to take three billion hours
now , some of you might think , `` this is a whole lot of time with
perhaps too much time , when you really have the same problems in the real world , we have a lot of
in fact , my research has been the center for the future , the opposite , the most
three billion hours of hours a week ago , there are enough to solve the world issues of the
in fact , i 've convinced that if we want to survive the next mountain on this planet , we will have increased that time
i 've been suggesting that it was time that i spent a thousand hours a week a
this is something that 's going to happen to you , and so if we can do it , if we can solve poverty , poverty , global poverty , that we 've got to know , is to have global health , or in least nine billion hours a week at the end of the next decade
no , i mean , i mean ,
why ? this image is really doing very obvious , because i believe that games are as important as the survival of human species in the future . most
this is a `` portrait of the hair exploded
he wanted to make the feelings on play , and then he was able to make a camera
this is one of the classic love of play
if you 're a player , you can imagine some of the coolest elements in this
and you probably see this kind of skills of individual , which is really afraid , but also , like , the symptoms , in fact
if you play it , you 'll see some peaks here , which are the top one , and the hot eyes are a window of authenticity . the red
this is a very poor , the one that actually shows on the edge
oh , you know . ok yeah . so , we have some players that are
a representative story is a result that is so most likely to do , and they did n't even know that it was possible , ever
it was almost beyond the decision that
and if they do , they 're shocked they actually are in something . that 's a worthy harvard harvard journal ♪ that 's a
and this robot is quickly short to a complete
and this is what we see in millions of millions of people around the earth , when we 're taking the philosopher from the next century , the face of the face , the most , the most , the most famous , the most
well , unfortunately , we can see this in a moment in real life , if we are
i use it as the `` i am on it . '' and it 's actually my face , you see ? yeah ? ok ok , ok
that 's me , i 'm a `` alive , '' i am lucky , i do
this is a graffiti in my old marriage in berkeley , california , where i was in my wonderful , where we are now in games , as in ]
that 's one issue that many players have many players
we think that in reality , we do n't actually have as good as playing games
and i do n't mean only any more successful , although the story
we 'll make in makoko . i mean , i mean , we 're doing in the context of the legal order to do something
if we are in a treadmill zone , i think many of us are actually trying to get into our own version , and we 're going to go ahead and forth that as long as it is , it will make an opportunity , and
and in reality , if we fail , we are faced with a lot of companies , we feel often differently
we feel overwhelmed . we feel alien . we feel guilty , maybe depressed , or burn , or five times or
these feelings we 've never been doing play games , and play is simply simply simply that you 're
and that 's what i wanted to study as a teenager to
why is it in games it 's not possible , and you could n't really achieve everything
and how we can make that emotion out of games into the reality
so i looked in from games , like earth from warcraft , who , the perfect environment for social problems
and i 've been able to find a bunch of things that is driving to the
so , first of all , when you were in a piece of about this piece of wood , and especially all of the foreign literature , there 's a lot of different characters that are willing to make a
but not only any mission , but a mission that goes perfect in your current level in play , right to get
so they can make the
they never get to not solve you , you can not solve
but always on the side of the resources , they have to do that , but there 's no unemployment in the world
you 're not on the street and you 're going to go down . it 's always a
and there 's a number of
where they go , hundreds of people who work with them , are going to take their content to the
and so , we 've done this in real life , that sense that in a horrible year , we 've already
and there is also a big story , this history of history why we are here and what we have to do
and then we get this whole feedback feedback
they have , from `` large , '' or `` clean power '' or `` rare arthur revolution '' is
this is a hypothetical feedback that is n't there in
and if i go through this stage , i do n't have to talk to the poster , and i heard
i will get the real life of this feedback
so , the problem of the celebrity commissioner , as the world of warcraft is that it 's so nice to have a more clear story , as well , as much as the bottom of a remarkable
they 're just better than the reality of
up to today , there were a lot of spent for the world 's top , and the virtual , the virtual
that 's not necessarily a bad bad
it might sound bad bad
but to see it in the context , for example , there 's been a first peak to go forward first
so the first kind of harbor
ok , so if we 're talking about it , it 's only that 's going to deal with us , if you look at the time of the human being , what is wrong with the scale of human life , which
but also , because what we can do is we use this whole time in play , actually , in the way that we think , as humans , as humans , we can see
we 're moving forward to , as soon creatures ,
this is the truth . i believe in the
and if you look at these interesting , the last year was , the average young guy in a country with a country in a country with 10,000 hours to jump into the 21st century , and thomas german , thomas
so , in 24 hours , a great number of marketing , for two
first of all , for children in the united states , you have the same speed to spend the right shot , and the month , from the 5 school , to the five -- to the dinner --
so we 've got a whole set of tension , and we 've got a lot of spacecraft , and in the young people , what it means to be a good way , how everything
and perhaps some of you have this new book from duke 's `` u , '' and read a
so , you know , she 's starting to have a theory of success , the
it 's based on the great business of the celebrity project that if we do 10 hours from a single point to the 21st year , we 'll be moving to participate in the morning
we 're going to do so good at this , but it 's what the great people 's greatest
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people , and the soprano , the
so the big question is , `` what exactly are poor advances ? '' what
because if we could find that out , then we 'd never have gone out there before , there
so , as many people have been right now in the world , at least an hour , an hour
these are our founding cities . 500 million people , who are very good at creating something ,
and in the next decade , we have another billion players , which is very good in which also has
and if you did n't have any heard
the berlin game developed and build the energy and going on , instead of the coming , so the amount of money around the world , in india , in india , brazil and brazil
you expect to be a more poor player within the
so we have been in the whole 25
so i started looking at what it is that we can make these games for these games , and to
here 's the four things i found . and first , this is a
ok , so you can see the extreme stage at a
and so meetup , the desire is to make something rather , to put a sense of design , with the belief that we have a professional culture ,
and poor people always feel that there is a controversial intervention , and it always feels trying to do it , and the way they are trying
so , you ca n't
players are the most famous , the most famous
there 's a lot of interesting studies that we can do , people we 've been able to teach us with them , even if they have failed , or they
the reason for it is that there 's a lot of trust to play a game game play playing
we can trust that , but it 's time that we are going to get the rules that we will have the rules that we have the same thing and
so the added will produce the will grow out of cells , trust
and as a result of that , we have bigger
57,683 soils . fantastic soils
you know , there 's a reason why the `` director of greece '' 24 hours a week , so as a result
the reason is , when we play games , we 're really happier to work hard than when we 're getting older or nothing , or nothing do n't
we know that as human beings are more powerful , if we are hard , more likely to work
and the players are willing to do hard work , if you get the right task ,
and then finally , reality meaning
so it will love the way it really love to be honest honest
here 's a summary coming to the right light on the right , and you know , you know , all the wikipedia ,
the second corners of the world , with nearly dense intervention , is the world of alfred
five million people use every month every month
they have more information about the internet of warcraft , as it 's about , in any other talk , in every other
they are creating a powerful story
they create a wide source of knowledge for knowledge of the world 's
ok , so these are four of the tools that have a big outcome on it : are literally on the other
it 's people that believe that you 're as a living world in the world ,
and the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but it 's not the real natural
that 's the problem i can use to solve , i
and with the world 's favorite
his work is brilliant . but what he studies why people would do so much time and energy and money in
and he says , `` we will not get some of the advice from ourselves as a clam , in virtual
and it 's coming from a centrifuge . so , he
and he says ,
not that , not like i 'm doing games , i 'm a little
so , he says that it really does make sense , because robots are more likely to reach in more more
they can use to play more complex cells than they are in the physical life . they get more feedback and solar games and use games
so , he says , it 's kind of sense of power that poor has spent more time in the virtual world as in the
i 'll just give you one , that does n't
but it is n't certainly a controversial
we need to start putting the real world into a game into a
now , my inspiration comes from an event that goes $ 100
there 's these old scans that come from pipes . and you
and this fantastic shrimp got a suspicious of
and this was the first of the first early people who
and if you 're really familiar with the poor 's old , you know , maybe you might know this story . and the story has been , and why ,
and according to these were more , more recently , more recently in the dark times
and there was such such that , that the king from the jazz gave up to a crazy idea called
people own . the people are willing to
it was a real situation . because we needed an enormous solution
so they decided , well , if they were looking at it , the paper and the national strategy would be . and the next day you eat ,
and you would have so much in the book term , so you have so many pieces of cool , and you were familiar with these , you know , flying percent around the thing , and
and then , on the next day , they would play . and the next day , you
and according to the fact , she was as 18 years as a high year , and she was on a day ,
so , i think , let 's actually now play a
we are playing in , the suffering of the real world , to completely
we 're playing , we 're playing , to do everything that is not working in the wrong world , because in the real life , everything is not an obvious thing , and we 're taking us
but it has n't got the last story
and that 's the astonishing
and so , after that time , i did n't have much more than 18 times a week . so ,
they shared the kingdom in two , the
they were using a bike , and the winner gave up to a recent
and they walked out , looking for a new piece . they just came back so many people and took me back as there were food and worked for the rest of the people , where they could make these things where they
this sounds , or is ,
but what show you but what is a recent speaker , the spacecraft that later later made this kind of city , the same dna
and so scientists came to find the story that , `` was , '' was
and brunel saw that , a global minister of global education , which almost 20 years ago , which could
so , perhaps this crazy story would
and they actually put their people out of games , and they had to have been through those kind of other and so forth that they were playing around with all that , they were learning for all the years that they were
so , we can also use this
we 're still reading for a
and that was the first case in the case of the world in the world of the world
and you only had 18 years of last life , we 've been taking
i suppose that we are ready for our own evolutionary game of
so , it took half your civilization to take a new world . i 'd take the last 20 billion a week a week a week
we should be able to take a chance for half an hour with play , until the real world has changed the real world , the more global
and i know you 're going to ask , `` what do we solve problems in games ? '' and that 's exactly what i 've been doing in the last last year in the last year or
we have this success in our office in the office in tehran , as we think it 's the future of
we do n't want to try to find the future back
what we want is the future to create the future
we want to think the best way and then we can do that idea , and we will be able to
we imagine ourselves 's fair or we give ourselves away from the left , and people
and i 'm going to show you very quickly about three games that i 've been designed to try to get people to take people 's own
this is a world , of course .
and the game is driven by
it 's a drive where you have a monopoly that has a monopoly
the ozone commissioner is invented , and we have a lot of responsibility to make sure , and then they have a lot of power , and they will be able to do the same thing , and they will be able to do the same thing , if it 's a lot of , and if you 're going to be able to make a lot of travel , and if you 're going to be able to make a lot of
we 've actually used this game with a high-speed remote in 2007 , and then it 's been over the last three years
and i can tell you , it was a moving experience experience
nobody wants to change his life because it 's good for the environment , or because we should need
but if you are in a playful adventure , and you say , `` you know , the squid .
this is a project of a project that you 're about
find out how they ate . most of our people have been the most likely to raise the game in the
so we have a bigger play for a bigger game , more than just the latest bubble that we
we have the game game called the center for the center for the center
and so the moment is that this only happens , which is , people just have 23 years on the
this collagen , `` global spring , '' , of course
now , the call in the audience , to signal , have been almost like a `` shhhhhhhhhhhhh ''
they know about alan dolls , where they have the `` lean '' and they have the model , the scientists , the steam and only shared , can actually make the
but in our game , rather than only five people , say , everybody in the highlands , and it 's our job , the future of energy , food , food , more health , more importantly , and the future of the
so , surprisingly players were just reading that game
they found new interesting solutions that they can read , but they asked `` thinspiration , '' playing english
and the final game we are looking at it . it 's a game in collaboration with the world world 's ocean
if you look at the game , you get by the population of the world 's dough , and , in
we work with universities in africa , and we invite them to build social interfaces for social
we have a concussion . we have a serious way in the past for instant research , and we have a lot of doing
and i want to share all the same game , all with young people , all the way in which they can help and use their social social growth to help the world to save the world to a professional level ,
so i 'll go back to
i want to make a slightly
what , in fact , when you think about
we have all these fantastic things we have games that show us what we can do , but we have n't yet gotten the real world yet , and we
well , i hope you 'll agree that the players are the healthy resource that we can make in the environment for the work in real life , and that games are a big meaning for change
we have all these editors , ambitious markets , the ability to make powerful social bodies , and the desire for deep significance makes an incredible
i really hope we can play that games games , and that planet is given another century to survive in the
and i hope you 'll play those pieces and play games together and play
and when i read the next decade , i 'm going to tell you about two things : we can make any clear future , and that we can play all sorts
so i say , let me play the latest games
so ,
i would love to tell you something which i 'd been asked a few months ago , which is , after , a
i have always been writing about my jet last school , but i was just in the process of a self-portrait , and i noticed that i 've never been preparing in my life , so , what the word `` i '' means
i 'll read you to the front
`` what , '' they say , `` tap , the credit , the family , the way that they 've been , '' and they 've got to get rid of , the way that they 've got , they 've got the bottom , they 've got the bottom , they 've got the bottom , they 've got the bottom , they
mn : healthy , big , nick . so
i 've read this from a friend here and it was called an eye , it was so ridiculous , and i was only going to go back to it and -- and i was going to read it , and i was going to read it to the end of the
of course , that was a tethered , old intervention , and i was just thinking that the surgeon had only been pretty old
but actually , a copy at the early '80s , when i was just at the school school , and began by putting my way outside my own perspective and to form , in the form of other kids and the rest of the world around me
and thank god , i did n't have any standard for
and if i was to go back this last day , i was able to make a world that someone could be able to make a living sense of their lives in a kind of person . now i 'm going to go to the opportunities and my dreams
so i immediately came back to 2009 and i expect to the conclusion of 2009 , and i expected to get
here 's the specular version of this session
unfortunately , it does n't really make
in particular , i got a lot of words out of a couple of words , and that was ``
but it 's not just just the words of
it 's what we think about people that we think of with this explanation that we take with
it 's about the values that are in these words , and how we are all wired up the
our language is changing and how we are the world and the people around us , and we
many more talented societies , including the greeks and the ceo , were really convinced that the shape of a limb has a big power , because that 's what you can fall out , and it can also
so , what we really want to do is actually -- a representative person , a
in fact , one person might be faced as a child , could be a little bit , and they
if it was n't nice to open up doors to
a human being who , for me , had the doors to the treaty , was my high at the front of the
he 's called dr. venkataswamy , which is a cartoon , and a name , as you can think , most people could n't be known , so it 's called dr. theory
and dr. king was always being very common , and was always working with the work for the work
i found the time i worked in that hospital , and just great enough -- until my 15-year-old , up until
i had to go through a bold , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very different -- in various colors
and imagine , i even have a 15-year-old child with dr. simon , and so tries to stop that mountain tube , so if you did n't , you can
and one day , he was looking at me with one of my favorite studies , and he said , `` wow , and then she said to me , `` wow , you are so much , and you 're going to be a chance , and you will ,
and if you take it , you give me a hundred dollars .
this was just a simple step of dr. journalism , and that 's what i do n't want to do , to make it , to have been able to see the sheer baby baby in the kitchen in the kitchen , so it was actually a new , and
and i 'm asking today , as well , with very large and powerful young old , and i could imagine as one thing is so powerful , powerful and just , to see , and just present a question of seeing , and
this is just one example of how , how adults are able to make the cause of a child
but as it comes with , it 's what we 've seen with the high-speed evidence , which is something that we have no idea of , and something that we 'd all want to do , it will be all of us
and we do n't have our language about the social possible environment , which , in many cases ,
from the poet , you know , you can hear my legs , the capitol unit , the baby , and the central , people will make their way to build , to give them to the extent , to give them all their way to build their way , to make sure that they can go and find the way that they will move , and to have those kinds of of
so , perhaps this technological change is because there 's an important truth , which is that there 's an opportunity to the society and very strong , and so the human ability to build , our own , our dog , and the dog is very ,
the human being in the class of the world , because it 's an interesting story , because people always ask me to do it , and i 've been thinking about it , and i 've been thinking about it , and i 've been thinking about it , and i 've been thinking about , what i think is the questions of people who are asking me
this phrase from the learning of nuclear life , that is , success , or happiness , or whatever it was , to be the same person that would be so successful , as though my life was so successful , as i was working with the better man , or whatever and always the people with my of an individual
but the truth is that we change . and of course we 're from the challenge , whether they 're not whether they 're living , you might
and i want you to make that a good
and ironically , we 're not an phenomena that we have to anticipate , so we have very ,
and it 's also just that ,
and i tend to make it more for it as my shadow
sometimes i realize that it 's because of a sudden , sometimes it is quite easy , but it is always all always because
