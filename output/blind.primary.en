yeah , good afternoon , my head , my hometown
so for me , for the answer here , they 're
and i 've got to say , now ,
and my name is willie , and i 'm surprised , bpa , who , a great ,
that means `` we '' for eight years
and my favorite story : the program , the last 15 , the public business ,
so , i 'm interested in the celebrity of this
and so you do n't necessarily know familiar consciously
i know the
and that 's what my son was , is kind of like , i 'm a writer , i
that 's what i said is , at the end
so alisa swam and donated e.
and i 've come to think about it , and , of course , a theme of this is a topic
well , with the act of the permian , because , as the world
we hope for the best and our time of the worst , which has got jack to who said that
you know it at
he was at general santa revolutionary recently
and then , i do n't go to go to this very
and i gave them a more
so we 're talking about , if there are a risk that we can get near a high , so we can get away from
many people are at the
it 's saying it 's called the ice
and somewhere in the eye , they have a boy , a boy , a boy , a little bit
it seems to be totally with
the ted boy is no
suddenly a train yield
leave the bell sheet ,
police , air temperature , mike ,
people are texting
the surgeon judge
and then you go
what do we do ? ok , excellent splashy
and we 're not going to do it , or we ca
people leave the building for the
children brothers brothers
and some of them might have , because all of this ,
suddenly a quick thin
there 's pigeons in the
and a panic of panic
i hear this now at the
the rest i have an observation ,
but it 's not an power i 'd ever collected . it 's
because this is a recent job in early angeles , in
there 's a very early school that 's
afterwards , it turns out that only , nine and nine , many , many pounds of
but people were really , so , a friend , a friend , that , to me , is told me
it 's nothing that has
and so , this particular thing about where my group , which my friend was , in my book , to my friend
god is n't aware of panic , even though it was n't as though they were n't as much as not
you see , in a crisis , in a buddhist disaster , there 's a very important story
communication is important because the people in this situation is actually completely into communication with communication
they want to know what is because they 're
in the case , when i was a good , old time , it was quite
we just did n't have anything , or we have
why much
because the so-called indra saw this
and so , you have to say that , god , people come from trying to design , and we do n't often tell the truth or we 'll
this is in a time that 's social media , in a time 's time , in the time of facebook and public and for the time in which it 's a period of money and a successful television , no longer
and generally because it 's not an efficient thing and seven times is the last one as an intervention that 's been the last ever last step
you may remember the print at the top center , a few years ago , a few years ago ,
the first report about this was on twitter
from someone who was on a microscope and just put in front of the brain , and here is a plane in here , and we now
that was n't a bloody
you can see , we 're looking at it today , and we 're just driven by the truth of the truth and very
because obviously , we can also see the last thing that can determine the truth , because we have an early budget of what we believe for that we only only
what 's wrong with public media or even private media is n't so high or they 're not simply doing this
so , we 're going to eat , and also , as soon as it has been , it 's also just that , as we 've been doing , as we
and this is where we 're going to take the good
it 's just as a form of a
that 's what we will be doing in the next next years in the next two years , in the ongoing two years , which is , some of you know that , when
and then , at the
you may know about , what biosphere looks , once long , and once a long time , and soon this
i do n't know about anymore
we will all do this with all the years we have in that way , so that we can , and then , on facebook , over the internet and around the television , and then , and then , with the same time and so , there was a lot of work , and then there was a lot of
and we know , we have to do very quickly and an infinite and we have to go very quickly and infinite levels , because the recession and our citizens are
and we also did n't believe anymore what we want to say to you
communication in crisis , or in disaster , is an example of some of the speed of all the media that we 're going to have to do , and it 's also a
so , for example , the green issue is our most important , because the citizens and women are waiting again , is all the wrong , or they say , are much worse than it is , in fact , it 's
we 've done a good job with facebook and twitter , and recently recently recently recently
and you may have noticed some of them some very , very few
we have a different gathering in eating a different gathering
and that is an instance of chemical
these are bombs that are linked to a high-speed photo , because the first thing that 's been said is that the first thing that 's ever done about the first is that , by the way , the dish in the 1970s , they only had to do the small one , the elected , and the u.k. has taken two different two points , and then there was a
the problem is only , many of these bombs have never worked , and as in the wake , in the wake of the
we then got an old writer , who was going to be a bit like this , we were going to go up with the fact , and he was now , you know , he had been abandoned with the u.s. , and now he had a state of this earth the way that there
since then , several more ancient years , they 've launched the
we 'll see what we all find everything all sorts
and that costs that they get to be a lot of a place , not
and so , we then created in our israeli park and emotions , just in a case of the word , a crime ,
and in the history of the city , the whole communication system , and we began to get into facebook and twitter , and the consequence that all the time that all
and the media was famous . fashion was a lot
we did n't have to have the people who have n't been with the police , but they have youku and
so , it was a great effect for us , because the aid rate is clearly permanently beyond these social
so , you 'll just do that , you 'll have to be a politician ,
i ca n't come up with this at the moment
and that 's because of this , because first of all , that social media has now the advantage that they
not so that is not so nice , because the members that are cut up there are really anger or the ozone , and the ozone
second , fast squared ,
if something is n't so wrong , it 's actually called you , so that the flow i 've talked about is pretty clear , because all the community 's energy at the point in the right is
and it 's a very high comment , so it can be wrong , and it can also be very rapidly , so it
and we have a huge broader debt
i said yes , so i realized that the very first thing that would be the way a wall of
so , from that point , we 've been looking for all the things that people have been happening in the last few years , and there are a lot more of them as a
and the city , every single day , can be carried up by these before
a bomb , which will have in an park , is not an that much , certainly not
but also , also , and also , we 're going to do this in the final phase , and then we 're talking about our peers and we 're talking about seven
and if they think of color , think about other cities , as well as it comes to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , there 's a lot of other paper that you can not do , where you will not see a number of other
and it 's important to see , one in a world , in a world , is still in a world , and it 's actually trying to stop very panic , to make sure that people are able to make sure that people who are able to this
and the social media helps us be more like that , and it 's because they 're all linked to communication , and it 's not just a thin demonstration of how we do this in the ozone , and also , again , even in the developed part , and
so today , today , not only a task of the government , not only to have a task on the air war or the polar , the drama , the sidewalk , red floor , but also , but you can see that in the late
and jill actually showed the following
there 's about twitter , and what 's been a big deal of aid , if you were only in fact , because suddenly , you could have been a little bit more likely to build , and you did n't know
and that 's a lot , for the public communication in suburbia , but what has happened for the public organization , but the way it is , it just shows that social media is created by a small way of being more important , not that it 's more
and i hope that you can have a little bit more of it , which is actually , in fact , in the beautiful things of life and the very city , and the way that we 're doing is , in the state of the world , and the very thing in the state of the world , and the of these
thank you so
so , a wonderful good evening evening
i 'm a very calculated
i 'm a writer and a dreamer , as you just heard ,
and i 'm also now asked a little tour to a certain nice challenge for
what it is , i will be able to get a break out , which i also want to
before i do that , i have to go back a couple things
the first one is , i think , is that we do n't think stories for
and that without ourselves without no life ,
but i think it 's a lot more of our very big traditions , fascinating , coming , and gave me a lot of ,
and then i think the internet , the infinite , which is , in fact , very much about evil parts of the situation ,
and four , i 've been struck by that , that people are so used to be made
and that they are angry , as soon as possible feedback ,
the more people happy , and it 's better to make the world
it makes sense
and this better world is only an ice version of
and the first line is , i 've said , bob '
and the story that i 'd like to tell you about , it 's in a baseball , right , in the kind of
that 's reassuring '58
and it 's thoroughly silent marriage at
now , they 're getting the luxury and the feedback , and they do n't really know so much , because the moment that 's been consistent in the moment is that
it 's happening in its head , in your body , with its perception of
and she has n't really really taken words
they do n't know what 's going on right
i 've also been personally words
i call this a magic from a controversial
and you can look at a page and an electron in newcastle and everything is quite black
i was like , `` i feel kind of a sudden
so paula
and on the other hand , we have the eastern line of agriculture in the south pacific with a
and it said , in that particular point , i think i would better and write that i 'm hoping by
so , the first thing that are now going to go with their new evolutionary sense is a total of a number of women who are sitting with , you know , you 're looking at it , you know , you 're
that 's reassuring '58
and jill then pointed on that , for a very particular kind of person , with people who
she was born as a biologist
so the players who are poor people who have been around their most work on
and those of you who know
very beautiful ,
imagine if you go to a bug on this not when you meet them , but from the way it was going to
so , we scan , mccars , tick , all
what is really important is that the players have no way of looking at
we do n't know when we die die at the
i 'm going to have a long time to do this , and we
it can also be over there , all the
and so , it 's also so that , in
they do n't know what kind of works it is , but actually
that means that every lost thing that would have been a bad story
a player who has developed his whole life , so it 's a dome , and the dome , the neocortex will have
now , you can ask yourself : if this is the same dangerous thing , why ca n't even make
the answer is clear : the same thing
without playing , without a way to every , followed , all the way , and it 's a player 's poor , and he
and they were born in playing
so ,
this story of jazz and how they are now and the world of the player , and then the first task , and , in love , in saudi video , is this story that i 'd
and in form of form of a
the first son has 12 effects , sorry , i 've seen a book here , which i only saw , until i only
so 12 cases in the first century with a long time from five to seven minutes ago ,
and the kind of verbiage , a long thing to look at , and , you know , the
television does n't really have to go through that
that 's not new new
and if it was all , then i 'd be making the first thing
and even at all , in
but it 's just going to happen right
so , let me go back to zip
what is the most beautiful picture from the film , or the ice
there can only be one , really ,
so ,
if we did n't think that would
and that 's exactly what my players does n't do ,
it 's actually quite a lot of numbers that
there are so many different games of
just imagine the ozone and ted , apart , and so on and so forth so much so
and that 's exactly how the number of crows actually has
and so there are a lot of stories that all tell you to all
now the next question : who wants to make this , because all
i 've already got a moment for me right now ,
i think of romantic design and powerful technology , and
but i know that a lot of the brain are more healthy than just one , although after all
and so it came out to the idea that if you put the crowd in the creative process ,
what if we could n't just drill and do n't just go away , but even even
so , when you say , you want to be very clear to the development of the creation of this
imagine , for example , there 's a mountain range of three that 's going to go to a minimum field , because you get them for the first dinner , you
and also , you know , it is a
and then you can just go right now with the technology , and it does n't even feel so hard to make a
and this store them on the hall , where it 's sitting , and this is really cool , really cool , which really does , really , really
that means it 's going up , it 's right there , it 's right there right now where it ends
the really beautiful story is , what we have at the
and the internet , you can actually do anything all
so , every medium , it 's such
that means you can write , `` will you be able to put this back , come up and whatever
and if we look at it again , this structure of
it looks a little bit counterintuitive from the local web
so this whole break , which has no idea
and i 'm really struck by making that the internet was born to tell exactly those kind of other stories that stories of
it 's not so much that there 's no way that nobody 's
so , i even go and further on and i 'm still going to go down and go back into the
and in a macro phase
and you can see the way for the surface of the spectrum , but also to people , but also , but also , to people in
boltzmann , who are very good , are kind of good , are sort of like male planes and jill roman 's eve ,
these were small areas that are very professional that has very
and i ca n't get rid of that , because i would need to spend another two
and we actually used to
everybody has already been a number of parts of
the first one is the neocortex area , the second part is the neocortex , and then we have the
with this little shell , i could have the worst one , moment i have a closer to do this : the philosophical innovation
they gave me the first few years to the best public power
and i have to say , this is a very popular case from the banks , the ozone , g , and so
so nice people , you should be my
and if i can get out , the internet is using , creating , creating , creating , creating , creating digital things , to change the world , i think , i can actually
so ,
everybody 's has said , why is this now because of the same
because in that name , all of these names are going
and we have the face of the soprano strike : who is she , you 're in , you 're going to have to
and then , of course
in the process , a lot of the world
everyone has ever thought , every time , every day ,
and then , of course , everyone is able to get a point in that sense , if he wants to
and that 's completely important to
i come from the arrow of the dodo , and there is nothing bad that way , when it 's a swamp ,
i do n't know if you know what it
and if you 're in the theater , and then the ceiling thing comes into the orange box and all of that , oh , oh
and this is not exactly the same
so it 's really active that
and nobody has to
he can only be just too lazy by
the reason i speak to ted speech is that this will also be the whole project to be in 2030 ,
that has another interest for a long
i 've been a project that i 've been asked by , and i 've been asked that , all the time in english , and i 've been
and i can only tell you , the german commons is the third of the
the gecko 's seat is english , and then the pink one , and then
so it 's not as if we are in a little more seed way of being a
and actually , actually , i really do n't really think about it as though it 's the other person that will be , as i think , will be grateful for what people were doing for a thing , where , that 's not being taken
if this is all the way i 've been trying to do , and then the first area is , actually , the first
and if you ask yourself now , why i 'm here right now , but then it was a little bit like the latest conference , which is
and i 've also made a few of my thoughts
i love collusion hawn
it 's not just
i 'm also quite dependent on trial and nostalgia ,
and there were a couple of copycat meetings that
and i 'm just saying that all of this stuff is incredibly important , and incredibly serious current
but it does n't use anything unless you do n't really throw it
and my project is just making a professional place , where i just looked at everything that i learned that i
and it basically uses an
and so far , it 's
so , i can only say
so , now , somebody thinking about this , i 've always got to think about my point , i 've got a lot of a great visual character , or i 've been thinking of it , but it 's also
you can find the internet on the
on facebook ,
great , as free , the norwegian talks
yeah , as i used to make
welcome to the question : can you listen to
question for them to
you can only cure memories
can you remember everything that you 've seen in your life , actually , is the
have more forgotten forgotten forgotten forgotten
who has the same for whom , who has already
and you do n't have a
so , you can have memories
it seems to
thank you very
no , it 's because of us , it 's not going
and so , the talk of talk about
and again , my name is samuel da pants yesterday
and i talk to talk today , and i was doing that because he 's two , two , two , my own incredible
i was here , and i was looking at it , and i was looking at it , and i was looking at it , and i was looking at it
and boltzmann 's time , i also become a war and more competitive and a professional business and a
on one side , i 've been looking at with the computer with a lot of people , and i 've been thinking about that in the brain , and the way it works , the which is the most likely thing that the
how do you do it , and
and it 's a really for
i was in a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , describe of nuclear nuclear
so , the question is : if we can , when we build a computer that works as much as the human brain cells , the human
so , and i feel that , after all , we 're pretty close
so i think about two , three years of a year , longer no longer needs to
but let me get a step , why would you make this perhaps a controversial bit of
so , the contrast between the computer on one page and our brain on the other side of
and if we take the computer , it 's called us , so your cultural park , your network , your framework , your framework , your blood cell , and also all of these
he 's called a brain donor , strategic ,
these parts are some of the small protocells
the word has heard , in a nutshell , it 's always as a tumor as a tumor
the retina little device , which is three degrees of dung and is n't making electricity ,
so , in our computer in our native group , we have a moment about five hundred dollars of these small 10 of
and there are the wild that there
we do things , we do things , we 've seen that , we 're doing things about , yeah , yeah , with even the behavioral message , is that it can only get a lot of time , very quickly
he ca n't do that
it 's actually quite ancient ancient
so , if we compare this with our brain
our brain has as a linear art that was the phenomenon , and then i 've been able to get a lot there , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion things are different in our gray
the beauty is , our neurons , not only three mothers , are going to have their own a stage for a
and it makes a cauliflower of a great leap , just because it 's beautiful , is $
these are 10 years ago with 3,000 cameras
so , look , so this is where the complexity of the brain is also a few more than what we 've seen as a
so , if we compare the veil of that , maybe the other thing , the first dna , that has been left by the first , the top , the bottom , the next , the way the divine , the more
our sponsor officials , however , but the box here has an increase for roughly 20
and that 's what 's called , and that 's what 's called the emergence of two big dimensions , and it 's not taking you , and
if we get to the world now we can get some bad about our own , faced great examples of news , why do n't we then do n't know
and maybe one of them -- one or another , what 's going on , is that the person is using 10 percent of its brain , and they 're just going to go
and then there 's a very wrong , and there
but , as you might , as i said , ten percent may be , but our brains has been in about that process , which is , actually , there 's been smaller , there 's actually our field in the middle
it 's certainly not going to happen because we do n't use
so then it seems like the universe 's greatest point of view , we all
you know , you know , the notion of
so , as i 'm using the fuel force , if you see the commands , you 're in the ocean , and you 're going around the top , and you get the moon , you 're going to
and that 10 percent , which is about what our use is , what is our use , our favorite point , but is still taking an infinite , and a huge drop , and a
we raised that statement , `` we '' how many times was we named a last bunch of acres
and , for example , when you come to find jump for those memories , maybe you might have an effect
people who were looking at a lot of more detail , when i was n't in the situation , and i was looking at the end , and then they said , `` well , but , but , how do you know how you
well , there 's a special , kind of a bee , so you will have heard of the airplane , so that 's what 's been , in a plane , and so , you know , in a single game , you know , in a single plane , you know , in a single game , you know , in a single game , you know , in a single game , you know , in a single game , you know , in a single game , you know , and so
and it 's not something that is so philosophy , and here 's what they 're like , not there , not every single house , every single day , every single person , he once he was , he could go back to paper
and then , of course
so , why is this , why ca n't we do that , but the power may be very close that the retina has some more access to the top percent of the top
and we 're also using that , but i ca n't tell you about the latest yesterday , where all the details that i remember , in
gary justin famously made me interesting experiences to make interesting experiences
he used to be working in the art department , and with a grant , she had no idea , which was no longer , the gecko prize of the brain , that is not , that is the equivalent of the game ,
wonderful , and so it was very well very
but it was about making people to go up and do n't
and it has been in a very safe meeting for me , or if you can , as if you can , as if you could n't remember , the top of the car , if you could n't find the top of the car , that would n't be released by the way that
and in fact , with that , with the kind of plate
the second thing that i was very proud of was that , he was telling a lady in casablanca , who said that her mother was playing them with the piece of paper in the piece of paper , when she
she sat on on a knee mark , and his mother said , read
and then he said , `` in a saturday 's case , read before ,
and she started singing , she was four years ago , she could n't read at all , you can see the word , and you
and then they said , he said , `` let me have the specular limb
they actually have a copy of london 's book , where right on this side of the text , that 's called the lady , the
so the brain is this site that you have , as it was taken ,
and then she read them
so , we actually have access in that , but we can see in the normal life -- we can have sort of embarrassing recipes , and we have no
so , we 're not thinking about the incident , but as the rejection said , he 's seen a picture , so what we 're looking at is that what we 're looking at is what we 're doing , what you 're doing is really the big deal , and as you do n't get a big deal , and you have a problem , and you have a problem , you know , sort of like that ant , you know , very
and , it 's now very nice evening , you can go up to mr. muscle , and i can ask you , just make a long time , just as soon as it just has a go long ,
and remember , you know , a very special , positive event in the late hotel , and
take the first one , and so the
and if you do this , you might be more likely to realize that it 's going to get a visual part of
and you might get an image , and maybe a film
and it 's not that , not that , because we do this kind of normal , but that 's what they do ,
and if you see that , it 's that you are either in the film out of your eyes , or as you can see yourself on a screen on a screen on a screen
and one of them tells us that we call a
thank you , you can have to solve the conversation , probably the eyes will go
who has got to make a visual information , and so ,
yeah , there 's a few minutes up here , so that 's like , like , a hundred percent 's been so far , yeah , that 's what i 've been trying to do , but it 's actually something that we 're often so often , that it was n't so often that it was
so , the bottom line , the
and what 's also , as it 's nice , when you 're memories , is that it 's not just that , and we 're going to see the most beautiful thing , so that 's where you 're all , you 're still seeing , but actually , we 're going to go to our memories and beautiful or different emotions , or another , or another , or another , or another , or another , or
and now it comes out to
everything everything was all about it , and yeah , to the brain that we actually have , the difference where we actually are actually familiar and we simply think of what we 're looking at , what
and also , they can use that as they go back at home and imagine something that does n't happen , they will be similar to it , and they can tell you what you remember , if you remember something else , which was in the
and , you know , these stories you 're looking at so immediately in color , which is the moment that at
well , this is where we were , and that was so beautiful , and the longer these stories , and the more , the more of the story , the story , the other , the other , the class , the other , the other , the other , the more , the days , the more more hot , was there a
if we do this in food , so if we do our memories , why do n't make it work , i just do n't make them an work
so , when i came here , my uncle showed me a picture , which is , of course , from his
a very nice picture , it 's a very beautiful german geodesic ,
just , the picture is , what the polar photo is , the black , and it 's kind of , because it 's a beautiful , and it 's a beautiful dog , because the sun has a great , right there , and there 's a picture of the sun , which is a picture of those particles , no , in fact , that of those
and why do n't we have this idea with our own thoughts , our own memories , `` yeah , what kind of things i feel with me , if i get that beautiful beautiful , and i
they actually have profound power in their own minds ,
so , negroponte , you know , as people who look at it , as they just do as dry , they can , you know , because
so , i have bad school , and i had a whole cut through the head
and the whole night , and this was , i was n't going
i think it 's the most `` the way that he 's making
the son , mr. friend , i was particularly depressed by that , because his mother in zimbabwe , and he was just quite happy to make them almost the
what the dad did , well , was , since she was about , she said , `` well , '' , well , what , `` well , what , '' what was the kind of
what 's because of the great , is , and then he 's let him go , and he has to come back , and he has exactly exactly what 's happening in that
and , in two weeks , it went out the son
and then it was great that the easiest path , which comes back to close to close to fall into
and it 's that , today , that has been a total alien to go , and today , today , one of the smartest people i
so it 's not the memories that we 're looking at , but it 's our focus on us , our focus on what we call up the way we use , and
and how much energy we can do it by
so if you were to have a marilyn and say , `` well , you know , there 's a thing that you 're doing , you know , , you know , , you know , , you know , there 's a thing , you know , , you know , there 's a lot of , you know , you know , there 's a lot of , you know , you know , you know , there 's a lot of , you know , you know , you know , there 's a lot of , you know , you know , you
so , what we call is we 've been pretty suspicious , but , you know , it 's a real one , yeah , yeah , yeah , so it was n't really a big , like , you
and then , just take that with a time
take that into your cubicle , and let 's have the current function
or , if you 're going to be a speaker , mountain , you 're reading your boss , or your husband , or you 're , you 're going
so , you can also see the image , actually put a compelling joke out , named french
microscopy , experimented with a bamboo camera , put them on the background , make them laughing , make sure ,
because it 's because they 're adopted because this idea is
and it can be much better at the situation of all
so , clearly the memories would
no , i think our brains have so much capacity that it can all be able to
it does n't matter because we can choose free , how much we feel about how much we feel , and we think , and we think , in an event that will feel a mind
my favorite therapist , you know , play with you , play with these images on your head , use your power to your heart , and give her a day that your lifetime will take
the good afternoon ,
so , for the story ,
if i was a proud , i 'm going to do what i do in my spare doing and i say , `` i mean , '' and i will make a cauliflower , and i see blue , and then i see blue , and i see the clarity of their fellow
so if i realized that it 's a world 's led to the surgeon , and then these former scans came from old images , which is where there was long , long , and so much , and it 's very frustrating in a lot of
frank dawkins once talk about music , as much as architecture , to dance , to dance
and so it 's something that happens to which we do n't make
so , you know , when you talk to each other , i 'm going to talk to you
and
and it 's a very counterintuitive ,
that makes it , from my view , on the point ,
since pisa , the infinity process of the timeless seems to make something completely different to make
we are now called between coal and the middle age , and , in our youth , a early in our native lives , which is incredible , and joy , and
but we also have noticed that the ceiling of the vessel and the next phrase there are little joy , very quickly , a little bit
and we are the economic ones that the notion of the classical music does n't talk to the content , but the music itself , but the top of the top
so let 's make a snowball , how can we make a snowball that the music will look forward , and the friends and that very return that we like to make this very much like you like
how we can organize a bicycle center , which is the idea of the boar
we put the mouse from the classical hills , the room , the room , time , time , the time , the light ,
take the relationship between the present and the musician and musicians
and you can actually see the stage and the opening up there
we 're going to try
and this is where you can see here a
the musicians in the audience , the local people , the way they 're flying , the ones in these places , they 're going to go down , they 're going to
and it 's going to be at the back of the
everybody who has come up , coming up to the stage , and go back
or , in the west ,
in the first book , it 's that you are more likely to do , well , as much as you can , and the thing is , and the point is
but it 's music , so you can actually sit in literally literally sit
and we 've been thinking of how to make the impossible word back
if you 're really moving to the other and go to a high-speed piece of music , you hear kind of
so here , we did n't actually put a stage in this particular room , four walk back to the audience of
and the audience would have been ,
so , as a result , the night was , in the
and what 's important to us is that we 're not just doing that , but we 're just talking about music ,
so we ask ourselves , what , what , but what , but what , but what , but what , but what , but what , but what , but what ,
and so at night , at night , at night night at night , you 're at night in the morning , in cambodia , which is only only only only going
but not just the spaces , and the lighting can get the music and the point , but also the connection with others else ,
and so we 're totally happy that we 've worked for a couple of years ago that we 're working with , to get rid of -- to create biological things , which is actually going to be able to dance
and so then , for example , the leaf hall for high-speed flight , or for
and this year , we have one , but if you want , this is exactly how you
we first turned out a book with a revolutionary conference , and we
we have the history of the soldiers with the kind of military paper , etc. , etc. , and we only got an
it 's also the same thing , because we 've been given a great deal , which we 've been doing in this
we 've taken over a two-year amount of money from people from the moment that we 've been doing in a
and in fact , this kind of object , which is something that
we are completely happy to have gone back to the very nice way , to the last day ,
and the city is exactly the size that we 're going to find great spaces and exciting places for granted , but also so small that we feel
when at the end of the year , what happened last week is from europe in the city , and just remember that in the city , more people with the more more more lot
the whole projection is , in fact
we are stagnating , a surprisingly mixture of students and students , talking to our students , their fellow , their fellow , our
and there 's a close-up about a revolutionary that that 's going to take the shell , or the way , and in the eye , the two , and the other , and , in a cage ,
well , it also happens to you that for example , the polar polar and the packaging , the mountain in real hands , and when you 're on the intensive , you will be
we all do this in our own part , and live in the germany
that means the most part of work is created and a controversial , and a
only three , we went from the year to get a democratic and other problem , and we will talk to the world one , and as a other issue , which is just the case that 's very cool , and if you 're going to make something like that ,
and then , for the royal self , then , 20 to 30 and a half american car will be taken for a couple of days , or a couple of weeks later , where the person will get their hands , the sidewalk
and of course , in those sunday days , the smoking
now , you can think of this , and you could have all that you need for
but our lander then goes further further
and we 've actually had these in 3d maps in the city , and a large community for us would be kind of way to us ,
and it 's going to go from the royal lama , and it also happens to you about very practical things , so it 's a heat one that we have with bread , or a cathedral , which gives us the fossil food
and the soprano unit is taken in the city of a grain in the city , and it
until then , too , then
we 've found a whole bunch of individuals , which are to get their children to the room , to make the best musicians there
and in this way it is , the whole thing is that it 's the equivalent of something like something that has been happening
they identify in a kind of particular way that this episode of the world
since the year , we were able to help the innocent people from the citizens in the local community in the united states , which is now , as well , now ,
we quoted from the recent stage that classical music says , as she comes out in the right hands
and so we 've been incredibly happy with that in europe , we 've already taken a look at the past , and we 've taken a little bit
if you can not imagine the best as well , like the principle of classical music , you 'll just see a few times more distant , just as soon
so we 're back in northern ireland , and we 're going to look at it , and we 're going
yeah , ladies and gentlemen , learning learning learning
you might think a car thought
i know it 's a learning about learning , or the effect of learning , but i mean , i mean , it has also a lot more exciting , and it
and the moment , as a result , is a beautiful public journey
what i 've learned from art and culture , now , i can tell you a lot of natural science , because today , the british audience , i have seen
and so i thought i would be able to get there , to give you something about there , to give it to something that had to be a
art is beautiful , but it 's a lot
they 've also been quite violent
you always get the laughter , although most of the shows , most
why is this so nice
and i think it has to be with what we do in the word a bit , what we can not easily predict right now
art that we also love to do , but what has been
and we 're doing this for the very work that was
sometimes sometimes sometimes
people who work that happens , which , what has been , for
but what we do is , we do it in the hall of the hall , and in the art , we 're looking at the realm of life , where we 're moving inside it
and so i have my epiphany , which i want to show you about three hours in five , all the time that all the time just started to talk about it as it is very simple , and it 's very
it starts with the launch , and then it goes to inspiration , and i will not tell all my youth , and i 'm going to go back , i think , the word ♫ i read , why i was reading that for my team , there was a
the interaction for the first time of my life , and then , five , straight
and , as you can get some of these , you will have this wireless
so , sophos_visitors , orange and
you do n't really think about that in the first two three years of three years , when you practice up the way
and so with 10 , 11 , i was reading this little subject , on the piano , not from here , from the driveway , at home ,
these are the same two life of
and it 's getting an explanation and it 's going to add the other dog , but
the translation is the right , but it 's flipping 's
and that , ladies and , is something that has been a little bit about the art that are being made , and if it 's two , the same , in its future , the future , things , are the same , the , the
and i 've learned , two of them , sometimes three , many , working with the bell , who started at play , every kind of thing , but in fact , to look at
that was what i learned with , among different different things , i
another experience i never did , and i had the worry that i 'd never be interested in today , perhaps as though ,
i have 10 aircraft , and it was still more and more people in the room than here , and in the late valley , i
i 've forgotten forgotten forgotten
i 'd played with a
so again , starting back and at the same time , i did n't really know
the audience has been more aggressive than me , because i walked in all the streets in my mind , and my music , they put , and i started the third time at
and you do n't think , like i 've noticed me ,
but it was a very heavy experience experience
so , perhaps that was one of the experiences that i knew , with millions , although i had to go through and looked at me , and i could n't go into my way , because in contrast , you can
so , the next chapter i did , i was , i was , i was , i was writing with , `` always
so when i was so so bitter , i went to my inbox and told him , mr. jones , i 'd like to talk a little
and he said , `` wall , that does n't
and you have to have a whole lot of work , and much of experience with women
now imagine a spectacular young man , so , young , a young , so a sentence , such a
i did n't forget for sure my
and from there , i 've also more hearing more of
and , in fact , i was in and then , and
i 've been doing , and i remember a situation that i never have never seen , ever ,
it was the revolutionary from the federal amazon , and now i 'm coming to the piece of work , i did n't simply realize it , and it was , and she was going to go to the best , you had the arm , and then you had to
i ca n't play that , not a tumor , and i could n't go out of it anymore anymore .
i 've taken this stage in my particular place , for instant , and suddenly i
and then i played up and i 'd leave you and i 'd put a laser on , and i know that i suddenly had an image on the ground and i would have dreamed
i 've come to be
i had nothing in a writing , not so , and the music has done me so much
a experience where i learned , emotions is also really a really traumatic
and sometimes it 's really true to work that you get into this dry , which is , you know , in that kind of dry fluid , in that
where all of themselves would go
and we had this situation actually then , in the negotiation phase conference in an
it 's almost like the other thing , when we walked the ozone bike , took two months away , where you usually wanted for a year , you 'd need
now , these were my experiences with the piano , with the kind of thing with a new
and now , i went to my apartment , unfeeling
i thought first when i was looking at a musician , but it
we 've selected surveillance imaging , mccars , mchouses
i have taken hooked , and so i 've been able to go so much for my bike for the music and the ozone
in the '90s , together , you have to sing a condom , you know , wonderful experiences that i also have ,
and then one point where i got into the research room , and i was , in the summer , and the interconnectedness , and i was doing this , or this story , or that , and that was , you know , in the back , that was , you know , in the back that , you know , in the back , that was , you know , in the back that , to the polar
the art of art , culture , to make my host up , to
so , this work out to art , but it 's not as artists , but you do n't have to say , but as a photographer , it can be as decoration
i was there in the theater , and i 've been fascinated in germany , just in `` i 'm a little bit , just in houston , and i 've been doing it , and i 've been trying to do it in the way that i 've done to make art , to create a good deal , a good design , a good performance , a good source
and the reason why i 'd then have been , i then , , is , in my life , in that , in a way , and over time ,
but before i was a different dodo , and this time i actually did with autism with
and for a christmas story , i
the german naval prize has taken his uniform at
i 'm a biologist , although i was growing in my own , in 1973 , and it was , in a lot of northern time , who was called the spacecraft , and i was going
but i have a humanistic political , because my grandparents were still the innocent house , and there , in berkeley , i saw the most advanced thing in
and i 've been thinking about this , and suddenly , i 've been looking at a different kind of culture , in a row , in a documentary , in a culture where people would live in this state device of a poet , and that
as soon as the computer station gave us a different situation , it was all in a very different situation
and i 've been doing with a lot of research , and i 've been doing this , and i 've been doing that , and i 've been doing this , and then we 've been doing it on the crazy music , so we 've been doing it in a bunch of years
we 've taken the topsoil off , so , of course , from the edge of the ottoman ridge ,
and this particular whale , which was actually the case of people
it was my destiny that i was asked by 95 obama for my christmas team and i was at the moment , and i was at princeton
i 'd been on the next day , and i had a nintendo card , so , the wall , is
so , again , i 've got very quickly for a moment to
and then there was an enormous city for the cities in the north
and i 've been able to figure out how interactions there are between each other digital cultures
actually , we talk to the same language , the music is wonderful , and became wonderful , but a lot of it has been
unlike the higgs book , it was n't as the world all of people , but it was a lot of the top , and so i was going to have a lot of the german identity , and the german crash has since the whole states has taken these two states
so germany is a very clear
and then , in the 1990s , there 's a more
but i was growing , but then i learned all the stuff all over the world , and
we 've been given a probe , so i 've been thinking about this , as i 'm here , and , in my sunday high day , in my inbox , and , on my
i 've still been even
wait for granted , you did n't want to write family for culture and julius
i was the first person going on the top
so , i 've n't really put so so so that , though , was wonderful that i 've been able to go out , because i 'd be in education for education and so women , and so women could go
we 've done a lot of urban space , so we 've been able to see this distinction between the fabric and seeing the world , and we 're going to see what we 've been designing , where you can experience things between the space and architecture , from the surface of the blue day ,
many , many , many creatures we could and i could and i and i 've been , and i 've been , and i 've been interested in that , and what
and by the way , i 've been more obsessed from the art , and more and more of the culture , that we 're seeing , which is what happens to people , and we 're going to take care of what they 're going to have and the of
and as a result , then the dodo sands was about that , seven came ago , at the end of the bee , the bee conference , the gecko was , in fact ,
but this last chapter , this fifth chapter , however , has the most
this word has two things , and i 've been around something , and i 've been able to use it as the verb , and i say , i 'm kind of , you know , that means , i know , i know
and it 's always in its community
i know something out of his way to him , and i 'm going to collect you or i 'm
and i am preparing by something , if i 'm standing up and i say , `` i want to , with me , i want to
and that 's a really big effort for a
five people will attempt to make sure , cool cities , and also , to identify their own way in the ways , to realize and realize that you have a community in europe
so , as big as we called it , but as a community we have called a lot of people , and yet , as we 're talking in , it 's as if we 're in a big life , and this is our approach , as well as it was , to the people and by , and
on the signs , on the greenland rate , many other moments of
a experience of the micro commissioner has not been as many people watching
there 's a marker , and there 's a lot of people , young school , young school , and young school , young people from the time , and young people , young people , were young from the same term , and young people , young people , were able to take the ones , the home , the home , the
and it was a remarkable effect that young boys were asked by young , young , young , and young , the fbi 's phone , and the young doctors were
and then one of these young kids took the piano , and i love this kidney , which i was
and then , he called out a letter , and i said , he wrote it home , and i just saw another thing , and i never play a paper of work , because my two fingers are just two , and i just saw my two fingers
and he stared took his fingers with a treadmill , and then he returned to the piano , and then he went on to the piano chicken ,
and it did n't leak him
it was such an italian actor that i was running at the time , so i said , what we really learned is really taught
we learned that a lot of people can make things , but we 've learned that we 're going to do it in a lot of partners , and we 're talking about it , we 're talking about , we 're talking about , we 're talking about , we 're talking to each other , we 're actually trying to identify us , we
and this was for me a wonderful , and you can see , it 's not just trying to get something that i do
it always is always learning to experience something and to win into an egg and
and if we were to make a lot of nuclear power and invention , if we allow them to explore that in the art and culture , to start with our own identity , we 're going to do with art and culture , we all have all the time we all have been looking at all the time and then all we have all of
and i hope you have a lot of reservations and zeros that you have , which will have been the
thank you very
yeah , thank you very
i think we 'll just wait for the first picture just
so i went up to the ward for the help for my particular computer , and
but it 's not a scientific dimension , but it 's about all i have here to find a direction and i 'm going to have a subject and i think , in a theme of where i think ,
through the latest words , i 've been working here , thanks to what ted does all at the moment , and i think in the area , in the area ,
and then , you know , you know , you should be wondering if you 're in english , but if you 're looking at it , you would n't see what i 'm going to say , i did n't know what i say to say , and i was n't going to go back and then get that talk and then german
and as we die ,
i have to start with you a first time
and rowing was the patient 's training in the hospital , where i was leaving the podium ,
she was about 7,000 years old , and always being stuck in love with the person , because she was looking at her man , who were on her man , who was the first man
and so , she 's a year for the first time , and she 's been long , and she 's a lot of a revolutionary time , and then , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
a couple of years ago , they 'd been watching and they had a similar kind of life , a long thing , a long thing , a
and then , as i was at the physician , and i was , as well , as it was on an cotton hospital , and also as she was born , and , and the discussion was also , as was said , is because that was
it makes sense in which people can kind of as a separate way to get better into the
so , the temes , to scroll at a grocery , to the hospital , is that there
and then she has been economic ,
and i come back to the next year , and i noticed , `` well , '' and i can tell you why it 's very rare , but in the time that it 's really so rare , and in the back time , the
so the question is , what drives me on that , if i want to figure out what one human way he is doing , what he was supposed to write in his business or what he was doing
and that 's a little , kind of , a little
so you can see the dawn of the movie , and what we 're
it 's a book 's book , and we 're going to work , a report on the
and then , it was so , very strong , so that you asked yourself , how it can go , it can go , it can go , connected to
you then , and you also read this in the book , you know , well , it will be more effective , so the parts always made the difference to
it 's going to take a sense of work , it will still become much more easy to go much more , for instance , for instance , and this was
and then , as it turns out , it was so much , something called something which was also invented by something , much less , and it was also much more organic , and it was also getting much more organic , and it was also
and that , after my ironic , people are still going to become less and less and more and more and more and more part of their work , and they were still doing in a small small way , where it was so much to be able to do so much
and if we were now just now on the ceiling and the medical sector , there 's a thing that is actually a
if you hear about tv , you know , `` the walk , '' and the most , and also , most of the most
and that 's no other , as you can get more and more , so it 's getting the same thing , and if it 's getting , it 's not being used to be able to do it , and also , also , the medical system is not used to
and by these goat , what 's going to happen to the column is increasingly increasingly and more and more and more and more that it 's going to take your work and use it with the work of personal contact , in the background of
a great friend about mine is now to go to the north , and he did n't want it anymore , and he went to the top , and he moved to the bottom , to get married for a doctor
the tailings sands , actually , is the most important thing , and he , the martin , was that there 's always a story that was now that there 's always no old people at the time , the more old people , and then the more thing that she has done was that
and then you come to the hospital , you 'll go back to the back , or you go back , or you
and this sent to a place , if there 's anything in which there 's been going to be about to me and to get to the end of this , to make something that you can have , from this kind of , from the hubble and
since there , but actually , after the language , he had to figure out , as he was learning that this exact same thing that happens exactly what was happening in this mountain ,
it 's going to die to die in a more
it 's not the coal industry that you have , but you 're still in a position , i want to be not in the hospital , or not the hospital , when i 'm at home ,
and then the indus thing will
in makoko , it 's a conversation with the graduate school , and it 's going to decide , i want to go to the hospital , and i want to go to the hospital , or i do n't want
so , it 's that , i want to be suspended , or i want to
this data goes back to a central and as if you can , in the same doctor , and then the absence of the pain , and then the decision
if we were to go back to the polls , and also , and what was also happened , and that would be a poet , and i would n't be making you , and i would have this second dance in may , in may , where again , they 'd be turned in here , that it would be that there 's
and this is my friend , which is there in the netherlands , but also a lot of speculation , as it comes to
so , in the last place , that area is about 5,000 to a $ about 100 percent of people 's military and not in hospitals , and it 's often a clear , not the normal creature , and the more likely is , and the more likely is , and the more likely is , and the more likely to get , and that 's what you see and all of these
there are a lot of life that are very well that are very talented people who will go back , so i would be interested in the year , so i would be interested in that , and i would say , you know , that might be a lot of a new kind of product for a lot of a of us , and it 's really that it 's really hard to
and what has happened , of course , of course , all of this , is clearly , and that 's clearly , and that 's really what 's been called , and the other thing that you 're doing is that , as a result , you can , as a result , you 're going to see a family and it 's a , as a member , i 'm going to
it 's not really the reality , but it takes two and a half of an inch of that fence , and then it 's still
so this advice of policy as a consequence of improvement , which you want to make , and also sort of , also , also ,
and now , i 'm going to do it , which is , you know , so you can take it from the last thing , so what we 've been doing in the last since is that i 've been able
and i just got the tape picture and there 's been the original picture and there 's been a little bit , because i think society is also as building as a building , and also making making and kind of , and also making
and in the book article , he 's that , you know , the human
and the second sentence there is to protect you , is critical , critical action of
and what i 'm proposing is , there is another picture in it , which is , every single one of those cases has to be made for the reasons to protect it ,
because it 's a way of being in this event , and i 'm going to go to another way and i 've been doing it in a way , and i do n't need to make a worry at what i 'm going to do ,
because , the last thing is , even though we 're not like to do this at the point , and then we will get a point
hopefully late , with a hundred or a musical
and so , as my job , as a doctor , i want to say , and i want to think about it , but in closing , if you 're in the subject , you might be so long in life , you know , you know , in life , you 're going to be in the life of the life , and you 're going to be in the life for the last time ,
if you think about it , then it will be important to go , and then you will find that in a second , and then there 's a lot of stuff , which is , because ,
there 's a book now , which is quite a very , very
it 's the kind of romantic , it 's the friends i have , which i 've been talking about , and i can see that , i 'm going to show you about life , and that 's what i
it 's safe between the person that i might like to deal with , or in the wake or the lower area or the dirt area or a square or a half or even other people that i have with relationship
and there are many other factors that have come up there , i 'm going to go through all of these pieces
but if you look at these three dots , you 've got a lot of many tasks , and you have to find them a lot of ways , and in the last way , you have to look at
and then there 's another factor that we see some sort of primordial experience , and i 've seen this here as a text or as an example for as an example for as an
other people can be these decisions and behavior that are out there , not just to meet the
and that 's my inner zoo
our dignity just could come out of itself , from
so it 's not the question , which is , what else is for me , who gets me me as a lot of money , or for me , for me , who is going
it 's the same way that i can go up and ask , where i can go to people , where i can show myself and feel my own , and then i can go through that questions and then get into that
and if you say what we 're going to work , and that 's what we 're going to do , this sort of thing , and then it 's a way of coming from the outside , and say , i 'd be thinking about
because no one can imagine me , as i can see myself , and i want to
and i do n't have to go there 's not alien to the general and i 'm not going to say , you have to have a nonprofit loss , and you 're so old , you can see whether you want to be an agent if
these questions , i can only show the last few and a half , more recent
this would be one of the people who 's a living kind of fuel that 's not able to protect the boat , and i 'm going to be able to get them , and i 've been able to get that , and i 've been able to have a lot of people who have been able to be more and more and more and also , who is the ones that
and to have these kinds of conversations , if you are going to make it , and i think that i 've been called this , and here 's what i 've been trying to think about , and that 's what i 've been trying to think about , which is not a big thing , where it 's not the first thing , that it may not be the first thing , but that 's actually a conversation there , there is an area that there ,
so , when we are old , we can say , well , what a dance call in may , despite maybe a few ancient age , that would be even a lot of time ,
so , thank you for your attention to
beautiful evening evening evening
i put two things with two
if you are the first part of the flat , you want to take a

there 's a different range
or it 's perfectly ,
and i
and that 's not good , when here is what makes you really notice that
so , in fact , but i also gave you , you know , it 's been , you
this is exactly because we do
we only went on a single single single
and i think the reason that 's a little bit might
dean , cannon , we know that we 're creating some of the time
and it 's for the rubber news for many different concrete
and when we are at the periphery , and we 're going two tube , which is where one of them , where ,
we know , we 've been seeing this in the box , and we look at the box , the number is small , and it 's three , and
we can predict if every one of any species that 's available the same number of
count how we do it , we have
that means that we just could take our people , one : two , three , we 'll look at the three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three
and she said , `` yes
very beautiful ,
this works in the ancient wonderful , and it can also work in great numbers , although
but it makes a
how do you actually give it a
and it 's more to realize you can see so many people like that ,
i was feeling over and people and people were , and i
so , we
you call that the stone
you can do this , and that 's clearly , right now , and now we 're going on the press , and
not , it 's very beautiful ,
so , it 's actually called for a thing that 's going to take a thing
you put one , you put them on a chair , out of the
the next iteration , the next iteration , everything is against , various people put different parts , there is an early amount of other that , there is an awful lot of
now , we go through the
and how do we actually allow two rules more
we would say that one is so big or bigger or less a bigger than the other
we could do it for the
we would go back to the
because , that 's wrong , because the point is , when you start to go to an infinite kind of busy , yeah , i would say , you do n't get the whole story at
alvin , transparent , is great , dry sand
so , how about the ]
goldfish <s>
no , and ,
she was doing that right now , just
so ,
so , now , let at a point to that
and it 's also because it 's all the absolute cause
you can see , actually , you can not end up
the point is , you 're just going to make it
so , for example , if i take the gel , you can have three , and we need computing , you know , in zero , one , two , three ,
and we would say , well , a commitment version of that , and take away from the rate of the free , and
and you can go up and have a lot , you know , two , six , six , eight
ok ,
all of these right impacts are cavitation in the infinitely great paper of the natural side , but there 's a bird that says , `` the other one , the real one , the right
let 's call the group of a lot of quotes in the simple numbers , let 's call the other
what you think of
is a demographic artist , it 's bigger than an average , or it 's
the big big
but that 's very , very well , yeah , in the upper election , the
who gives another cure at a certain
there 's
they say , ``
ah , it really does n't really feel a plan , so
you can not be able to do that ,
you ca n't be able to think that , in a lot , that does n't really mean
okay , you say , ``
you would guess that you do
this is the standard stuff that you 'd expect , obviously that is
and now , now , why the most important thing are these two
and as a result
and that
yeah , we raised infected
that 's the point where
we put together
we take the zero out of the right , we take the zero from the natural , growing , out of the
the next one , after four and two , two , after the coming , is one of the zero , and i will go
the four , the two , the six , the three , the eight , the eight , the eight
and you can also pull them around , and then it 's going to happen , and
and it 's obvious that , through the tube , we can do it in the skull , and it 's still in the teaching ,
and here , there is only the only one , and the band is going to go , so
we negotiated the natural gas on the right , on the right , and we 're going to get the ozone leap ,
and that 's only a question of
so if you were to explain them , we learned what it was like , what is it , that is , that goliath , i know ,
an infinite property , which is , and this is not an actual , and this is , is fragile , a truly lower , which is exactly a truly , that is
and they do n't do this in the kitchen address , if they are in three people 's three people , and then there 's only one , and
yeah , we did n't make out of

ok ,
then we 're going to make a second part ,

so , let me give the credit a , b , george
i 've been hidden behind something , and i hope you 're not fully sure

so i 'm really quite honest now , just now , quite quite a slick

and why i tell the story , where i would tell

it 's like , or we can see the way we can see some of
well , north korea , but i 'm not able to tell you that i 'm going to tell
the theme of the old men , the electric
and it 's all about
and what was always important about me , is the fact that you are actually going to experience this big trust , the spacecraft that we all need , is going to do this , to do this much more interactive , i 'm going
and it was very true for my parents that they were like many of them , my brother and even me , and i was n't
we were the first ones , and so suddenly , you know , suddenly , you
and then you have to kind of kind of sense of

there 's the blind baby that he would have , with a filmmaker , with a filmmaker
the kind of material structure that i have this complex
so this is with the great -- these are n't just good for the remains of the remains , but also for

but we 've started with laser , or eventually , eventually ,
and then the great question : how much after taking two times out
and as you can trust the trust , one of the kids who will tell you that kids will actually take time and leave the children back , and the other thing will talk about it , and the
and our point was that , of course , we 've been told about our parents , where , where , where there 's a lot of our own , where , in our teenage way , these are -- in fact , these are -- in which you 're not going to be -- and that 's how
and we had to zoom in between our patients , but the point of the exhibition ,
and you can not test this moment , because otherwise , you will have anything that you are never , you know , because you do n't have
but quincy . but luria . if you were on the light , and you have a lot in your bedroom or in your life
and you can just , just do n't have just blank , and you have to go to the tongue and you will think that it 's also as if it 's as though -- and they 're
so , as the bats that look at these as they are still like , they 're known , they 're now white and , tiny resistance
and that 's when i trust you , and it is , in a sense , trust the movement ,
but he agreed to have high and the security , so i am a chance , i gave it to be honest , and
and i 'm also going to go to the big things and clear , and there are no lot of wars , one of which
what i 've also done here is no pictures , and i 've seen that it 's very shocking to a lot of , and
from the surface of the day , our lower building was

and i 've been very rich , because i 'm a person who 's been going on in the hallway and i 'm going to have a lot of time on the science , and i never saw it , or is n't that , or is i never looked at it , or
so , the more thing he ever did n't have on
but also , it has to do with that , but it 's not all that thing that 's
diversity is the force of the form of our line for the most important thing , where i 'm going to be doing , and i 'm sure , what i was , and i can

and then the consequence is that , the consequence that we get three square square , and we had three square profiles , and we had the same with those with a clear , and no knew what ,
because , because trust , then it can be gone ,
so the dad said , `` god 's sake , help , '' that would have been , and then , in the end of the situation , that one would be afraid of us , and the final bang , `` -- and -- i know -- somehow ,

and this was , and i was very excited by , for me , very great
but sure , not necessarily , is not an embarrassment , not a threat to make the world back to
and to me , the different species that live in my life were , all of a sudden , interesting
and most importantly , all you have to do was go up , because i could see : where , you know , and i got my perspective , which is
so too late , i 'd never be able to do
i never had the widest beacon conductor
and i go down and not like , until today ,
i go up to this place today , which is
now not at five degrees , as well as the

you only will be fast if you just take the whole confidence in your technology , in your
if you have that trust in the own scale , that is that you can also do this on any research , to the very bad , to the larger , to be able to get the place on the back ,

and i 've never been interested in here today -- i 've been using the word -- which is -- there 's only one , but it just has a -- as my last ,
but nothing , we do n't make it back again
i 'm going to start away just now just now
with one , one , one , one , one , one , one ,
and what i 'm going to do is i think it 's the theme of my point , that is the epoxy , that i think i can give you the audience , how it is , if you do n't make it
the final minister , so , you know , two main threats in hand
so , from that point , i mean , i no longer lost a lot of , you know , i could go back to my own

and then i came up with my rented , which was a
and the point to that with the voice is the
so , it has to make the case that
and also , this is important for trust
the most famous thing in communication , so the bishop in
and the soprano point is , if it 's ignorant , the paper says , `` on 11 , that 's what we see in 11 , and i know it 's going to be a bit of the left , so the top part of the world 's back
if he says , on the one hand , on 10 to the left , and when he says , on
okay , all the crazy
and then the final expressive computer , because i have to wait again , or now , he has to go back to me , so i know that you
and for me , it 's quite big , so if the dodo prize goes to me , then i have really been totally moved to the really thing , to make it
and to say , it 's the only thing to say , it 's the tools that i will just bring on , but it 's also so easy to do it quickly , and in the gulf
and it just can only get me if i can take any other , and i can zoom on to a leg , and i have to do the eyes and i have to make it right -- and then you can also open , or you can also make
and then it 's so much so low-tech , and so it 's going to go back to the other leg and again and maybe you can get a lot more
it has also been a
yeah , and this is a very important thing , if i was to the bp , i think , i was a guy , so i was actually making people who are just trying to say , `` you 've just made me the right thing , because you know , this is where you see
so , the knowledge does n't know what he told me
so i am able to make the path from communication at the end of communication
and that 's what 's happened in every
and if someone ca n't know my need , i ca n't help them , but i 've just been asking it here . ok , i need to go through the line of the curve , perhaps that
or i need to say if you look at the fact that i 'm just going to tell you the mountain is because if we think the drought , you have to think about it , but then you have to go back to the first time ,
and again , what it does is , it does n't really sound like
and that 's a little bit , as i 've been looking at the pilot , and then , on the original , that 's what i 've been saying , and then we 've been looking at another couple of minutes , but it 's still a time of a bunch of other minutes -- but ,
so , from that point , it 's also important for me to have the right to have strong
i 'm hearing the horror -- here i 've been looking at , and then there is
who 's going to
so my time was , well , that was going to be down , and in april , i think , i never saw that much faster as much as floating as i would
and at the '70s , at the moment ,
and for me , as i said , these are just about a very possible time if i just open my ears at my
the other thing that just looks like what he looks like , and i think that the possibility that i see , is my potential
and that 's what 's really important to me , and i say , `` trust is actually the same and not the other
so , not so much , as a person , not so much , is frankly --
because i also had the experience that i had a left right left and left , and left ,
and then , in the summer , there was probably because , after the three feet , there 's
and i 'm the three yards just to the

then , of course , surprisingly surprisingly , often , we
but for me , as though , as a neuroscientist , i think , as a result , i want
and i have to say , `` i 'm a somebody who 's not seeing , but i 've been able to do it for quite a big life , because
so , in the course of the galapagos , i 've
and then , as we get up , we have a burning of water going on , and i 'm standing down , and what i 've been saying , and what 's -- and that
and that also can be done , if the patient has seen that there is
and if you find somebody who is actually going to be a tremendous percent of that , as i just think ,
and with that , with all , i was also the same
because that 's the theme that i want to talk to the next time ,
you have to have the same goal , and you can also be really obvious to see this , which is because it
because it often is often hot to a lot , that you used
i trust those robots or the ones or myself
but that really matters , and that 's a lot of a much level
you can think of it for a much more elaborate
and you too -- -- because we do all of these with concrete things -- we want to make a sense of purpose
and the sense of this , it 's often very often that we 're only able to achieve a nuclear target
and that 's what we were doing . in my case -- from a few , i 've been standing on the back to the landfill
and i 'm here to say , i have to say , or i think , or , or , in my case , or , in that case , i think , in
and then you make it , you know , then you can actually start at the top of
all right , i heard this was the wrong advantage , i did n't find any things where i did n't see , when i was to ask for
then i got a big job of
it 's got to be sufficiently risk , and that is ,
and i 've been working with these fear , now , well , about the bp , i have been , and i 've taken it , and then , in berlin , there was a minimum , and then there was a huge film with a synthetic conference with
that 's kind of embarrassing , when you look at the car , and you have to do a lot of cool , you have to see the way , and you do n't know what it is , if i get
and these things , and i 've been so interesting
it 's clearly the shame but just the point , but i want to know the thing : i know , `` i want to know , '' and i want to know that i 'm the most important , and i
and that 's exactly what the most striking picture was , because if you go to a top mountain , you know , you 're going to go every day 10 hours , and
and you go , and it 's only around that around every day , less or less
you take on a macro board , you have a charming name of a poet , who
so if you see goldie hawn , then the stereotype is roughly the last half the last half of
and then , as it seems , the
we have just looked out of the distance , and the other time ,
so , from that point , i was giving up , very closely , at the bedside -- despite all the strange points
and i thought , `` well , well , as i said , i was probably wrong away , and i was probably making away from that , like
but as i said , it 's closer to quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite
and right , it 's going to get the case , when something
so , if you go back to the corner and the air air air
or if you 're on a nuclear , when you have a little bit of little little fever , where there is
and then it 's so beautiful , and if it 's still happening , it 's also happening by nike , and then , you know , the news story , and then it was also coming , and then he was actually going to go back to the ocean , and
because , as i was , as a person , i think , it was sometimes too hard
and it 's been a little bit that i 've been able to say , well , i can tell you that , i can tell you , i can say , from my favorite , and my friend , who was a
but i need to also be an ideal form of security , so i ca n't have access to that , but can you imagine , when you 're on the mountain , you 're going to go up to the north , the
and you get the end going on , and all
so , for us , we have been in the case for the case , so we 're looking for a particle , so we 're putting a tissue on their fake , and then later , after that , i was at
and in the other rose phase , i 'd go through doing a little bit of the two , the top
and it 's only even with you at the time that it 's called a little , when your pet , jim smith , i just saw what was going on with me , and i was n't going to focus on me
and what i 've really shown is , it 's as though it 's really , when you 're really , again , that you 're actually having this effect in north -- it 's just that , as long as the polar field , with the buddhist propulsion system , with
but also , it was , and i realized that if i was in a position , it was just a question of being , if i really got really clean , and as though , the top of the top , you
and it 's also that , in others , the abalone area , how trust it is
when we saw just the mountain mountain , we were very much of the group of that , and we 've been all over the other half , and i 've been thinking about why , why , if you can , ever as anyone , he 's now that he can never go back there and he just saw the behind us , he can never walk back there
in fact , you ca n't go to the girls who
it 's kind of no way of the
and then i realized in the trial , and yeah , sure , the trust in your mind is also suddenly a good cartoon , a
you 're going through the dark , you 're going to go through 12 o'clock , and then you had no
that 's completely because if you 're ignorant , the air is tiny , so you 're only going to go back , and it 's only
and then finally , when you have said that you have said , `` hey , that was completely easy to go back to , because , you know , the friend of me , all of me , '' i 've always been trying to figure out -- how women do
and all the night , what we all were about to tell us , and the people in the group was actually the same as the subconscious , which is , it 's now like , is , in fact , like
or , i , you know , it was n't much about the outside
and that 's what you might have , but it 's just a little bit more now -- you might have -- there 's only one more hour , the sun goes back to the sun soon on the front
these things , which also , for example , can still increase , can only increase , and it can only help that you can actually see the personal hole
and for me , there is a question , and then , if there was , you know , there 's a real , and so there 's a lot of blood and that 's really going to go right ,
and that 's obviously , in the kind of sports that we 're so so ago -- actually not really , not knowing why the people -- i do n't know , i know , `` oh , but it 's only even the point to the point of the point ,
so , when i first came up with something , it is , in fact , a lot of
if it was all going to be whole , i 'm not sure i 'm here , so i 'd go on the
or at least in venezuela , nepal ,
and as i said , i 've been doing this really , and the way to make sure that i can actually figure out , and how i saw my skills and rules on a point at a point point at a point at
so , as i was in my skills , but of course , in the team that we all need , we do n't need to , in the course , in the work
anyway , if old or young soldiers , we have to make people also , that we can trust trust us
and if we look at this right in the head , that has been able to have this thing , and it 's the best proof that we could actually help in a project where we could
and if you can , you can also see the yourself in other parts of other
so ,
well , one science for me , this is the title of my talk , came from after katrina after katrina
and what i 'm going to do is i want to give you a very controversial picture of how the science learns , which
in fact , i could be pleased with
when i come across in a comic coma , all the way is , it 's all the time with the kind of
there 's a range of bloggers from the last ted , project , excited , where scientific things are concerned , it seems to be quite honest
every tv has a monopoly , where , kind of , scientific things at
again , that 's completely annoying when you watch what it 's on trial and valleys , with kids with the scientific information at
every single thing has a own place in the gulf , but yet , after that , is so much recent
science is one of the things that i love to show you , i can read reading , but that 's not what i do n't , but
cool , obviously , is just doing on a lot of weight , on a lot of gender , on the weekends , somewhere ,
so , in tourism , a minimum five minutes has nothing to do with the reality , but that 's cool , predictable ,
there 's a lot of my mind that
big bang , where i can see laughter , i do n't understand the phenomenon , but it 's great great
that 's extremely bad ,
because , it 's kind of an identity that we can only only solve with the problems of this technical and challenge of the
but at the same time , no one 's reduced
i 've just seen a little bunch of examples of how science or science , or the way , or so
you have a very ambitious example : in london you have a beautiful tower , the architect , not so much , we do n't really have to take so close as our
what happens now is that the sun data set up in a go down , i realized it would have been called suspicious , and then somewhere in the other report at a point of moment ,
and the day , the big through the press , is a clear clear
so , the heat , so the heat to that , that that poor lines that actually had long since long , there 's the purple vents of
so you want to ask , like an architect , which is actually something like physics , because i mean , yeah , it is really news that a mirror is looking at a mirror in which a mirror
so , what i 've found is , it 's been , as it 's , is that it 's kind of busy , is kind of like
and i really wonder , what 's the more interesting or architect or that , in the moment ,
now , it 's a very pathetic example
a colleague , which is what you have in these last trials , is also
so , solar engineering , which is a few years ago , when the way that kind of just looked at
there was a very popular , because there was , because , there was , there was , called
so , there was a complete with
so , they were kind of
and then , oh , there are genes in
there were situations where the market had really been in the market : hey , i have a self-driving vegetable
and there 's no idea about what that means that
so , yeah , okay , speaker , we can get beyond the break
but then , at the time , i was living in the lab and where i was totally frustrated , because i was trying to make sure these evil figures in my bacteria , so
and it was quite common , and my favorite year-old phone , and my family 's married , `` was you , you know , you 're not
i think that 's the first thing i 've ever been able to make a little bit of a little bit of my bacteria , and
that was what i 've been trying to explain to , which is , kind of , the way there is a population , the first , i thought , as i talk to you , you know , you know , what you
that was what i was actually , a certain sequence of putting into this scene of ted , and i wanted to get into
but that was , what the woman has been doing ,
that woman , in that woman , was the hand
and i know , who i practiced , scott fires
genes are all very evil ,
now , it 's now good for 10 years , and yet , this kind of , in response
so , the background , it 's all
and for a break , i did n't read
it 's always a whole massive technology , and it has , but it has , in our
and the billy may go out to europe ,
now , repetition is kind of different from the other categories , which is n't
another , another , more , has some more speed
yeah , it was also a beautiful recent leap
but it 's not as old , and it 's also quite interested , i think , on what i 've
no matter whether it or the picture , all the online talks , all
and luckily , it 's not yet , not yet , but it 's not , but it 's also that it
but it just shows that uncertainty is in the population of population , because they 're simply not moving to the issues
and in addition , we have to do the actual technologies that
now , it was just unacceptable , no one had the big bang , but it 's going to go out about things and just like most of things ,
and that 's pretty sad sad
and it 's actually where we actually got those information from the back
if we are looking at these little , and we 're going to do our experiment , and what an experiment was , and what is happening , and it was , and it also happens , and it is , but , of course , the person
and then the first thing to do the twitter
the head who wanted to , okay , honey , put his name up in as the ] , is always important in science , which is always important in
good idea , i 'm still not in the fueling , and it 's about a geodesic geodesic
yeah , the sensual point , oh , wonderful idea , so you know , we have a press ,
so , two-six , we have a press with a project , a beautiful idea , and then it 's coming out from the wild
so , this is going to be launched , yeah , but
now , these ancient smile are either low , and they have a common , a common accountant , a
and from all of these , you will have the timeline , which is really quite exciting , and then there will be a little bit of work , and the general bang , if you have a duty ,
that 's the path the
it 's going to continue to get you on the ground and see , within the plastic , and the kind of plastic to the right , and really cool with really
these are ongoing studies , they 're really well , there 's still free , but , but who can actually give me this at the end of
basically , just those individuals who are interested in interested in
in the lunchroom , we 're all doing this the latest increase
so , the way that you think about that is that then you 're going to think about that and then the newspapers
beautiful photo , the coffee that you 're interested in , and you might have something about one , where on the top , it 's actually in the early event
but the tenor , however , but i
the legends that these were interested in it is
well , it was , the state revolution , i call it mr. simon , which was used by the various guy , i was trying to get it to the things that i do n't really do to do so much .
still , again , our future will only make you feel better if we are dealing with these highly highly controversial
success , renewables , these things that are all concerned about is the default , the most famous , and the author is n't really understanding , and that somehow , after , he
my project , and my idea , to be able to go up with these little little , very completely by its normal little bag , and give them a world , a few which is actually a given to how we science of science and science
and what happens is , of course , i 've been looking at a woman , and we 've been talking about it , it 's a constant power , it 's not a constant power , it 's not going to
and he said , `` well , he told his job , he gave us away
dean , these are scientists who are telling me what 's going on from
matrix001 , sounds about , diplomacy , is almost almost as the same kind of walk as genes are
so , cancer consumption , which is kind of , oh , oh , you know ,
the really thing that happens , and all of a sudden , you know , there are a beautiful one , and the people who wanted to talk to you , every time you wanted to talk about them , and you might say , well , just some water
where the problem is , actually , to talk about and value ,
and so i 'm going to go up with this idea , these young scientists who are n't really close to the hierarchy of the hierarchy , which is a little more elegant than the school , where you do
that has to be used for everyone , as well as whatever , as it always means , as the way , who want to know what
and eventually , as it turns out , as it gets to be the cause , which is used to be used
but those of these communities , that 's just a story
and i want you to take a very frustrating and should have a point , you know , you 're going to see a card , you 're going to have a leader , you
there 's a quote , and i do n't know if that 's the right one that 's speaking about suffering , and if you ca n't make it , you do n't really
so , the scientists from the lab and actually do it , and the project is to really start , how can i communicate through
so now , there 's a long
so , the tailings sands is completely modern , and , in any university , not , but also , only after it , i only had only
who makes it to the south end of the city in a row , and then there 's a talk to a speech where there
these are the ones that are really interested in
and then i went back to my
so these are the people who are interested in this , who are going to go down and get the biggest talk of
that 's beautiful , and so they 're getting these kind of recording , all you 're working with , you 're happy , so you
so i 'm still waiting in a second piece of point , say , it 's not going to be the
these scientists also become more sophisticated , like , more likely to
because it 's because there 's a lot of really who are going
because scientists , like the research systems , and as children start their world , is identical
it 's a very strong scientific
they do anything that makes you go to
they try to figure out , so
and so , back , no way , well , the next thing , as it does , i do n't make a bunch of
children learn extremely scientific science
these are really destructive , prozac and smiled , i 'm looking at what i can make up the thing that it does n't work or not
that 's normal intelligence
but there 's a lot of
and so , from that point , it really is very , as soon as the polar world and the kids in the neighborhood , and they 've been doing with the kids , and there 's a lot of things that are being done with the kids , and there 's a lot of things that are being given , and then there are really , the kids , and the scientists are actually working
and then you might think , well , you know , you can see , this is my hope , just as well as the kids who are too home , and then also , i also got to the very golden , and then the children who 's interested
this is not somewhere in the newspaper , but it 's not that it 's a little bit of what has been through a treadmill , and it has a very , very , and it might also end up the way an architect like an architect could build a house , so an
and not only , you know , i have known excited of mr. tso ,
this is my idea , my vision , my project ,
unfortunately , it 's just that , the first stage i 've called said , yeah , no way , so , as we say , as we say , as a result , it 's not just that it 's just a problem
now , the researchers need to communicate with
yeah , so i feel like , ok , i 'm going to get the next
but who has this exploration , and it 's a company , and it 's also the case that the next step is , and
thank you very
i 'm crazy , the question is ,
so , you ca n't do any day
and the last week , terrible
the weather has made us a big trip through the chinese for
seven , eight years ago , i was asked to be happy , if i want to take
i was struck by ceo , almost 10 years ago , and the latest documentary in greece , and
we 're going down pretty far here . and
and before we had more
and for me , this was really , ok , but that is , you
what this actually does is
so alisa , it 's actually quite
but i 've heard the drawings , and i 've been standing here today with the
and maybe it 's a little crazy , but it 's also a case of a more emotional case
it 's beautiful and it 's always exciting and it 's
and i 'm going to show you only in the next 10 , and i want to tell you a little
i am a graduate student at
the company has been there for many and the last
i am a geek , who
this company has been over for over the
and the conductor , of
the company has been responsible for thinking for or more ,
the antithesis of the sun , the most
basics chen
and that 's a picture that i want to show you , which is actually a red , like a bed , or anything , or anything , not that , but that point has also come up too large , and it
there 's only a total scientific british geodesic
and it 's actually just 10 active atoms , actually
it shows what 's happening
there are about seven thousand individuals in the world
so that 's actually not a market that
it does n't even have a memorable ,
that 's a tethered , a controversial biologist
and the question is , well , what makes it actually actually this
and as it turns out
and if you were to put the gel in the front and just the point , we can tell you about
and so quickly , just
and so , `` yochai , '' he took a lot of crazy
a strange load wild
until we went up to los angeles , from the first world , 2011 ,
then , in the first war war , joel 's king got out , and the crab , and there was taken
they have london , london and so so , so so ,
and as we walked around and eight and eight and we went to london , and we had a big surplus of an original privilege with the recording , and that 's what they were coming , but not of four , but also , in a very
so the story has been a lot where the
and we had an exponential campaign of
but metamaterials , the quality of the race , was n't that quite quite obvious , because suddenly there was a lot of work that were going to go out there ,
and , by the way , these were for marketing , a
but yet , in london , it was a great epidemic , and the country in the north , many years ago , was very bad ,
and we are not a very lot of
then , over and then , two months , there 's basically a
and actually , in fact , a daunting case , which then after
and that has a myth that the whole democratic nation has turned up to something as if , and , in fact , `` the rejection , ''
and then there was a new york coming with extraordinary imaging at
and the whole group of education has taken up , and we have to be
and this is in everybody 's life , and this is really a little bit of a sudden that myth was
but actually , until you 're five , six or five , seven have been built in six , and only two , and only two , and just two , the most important , and the the
cotton , third , where were from the fort border and and now , there was a
but it was a myth ,
and the then then the first room was , in the first middle , was a state of
and the potential that ever looked at , where there is an illusion , a product , and then you can never have the first
and the other players , they also
and then jill , the last time that last ever studied
those materials are used for artillery , which , in the hubris , the
so , for a long time , we
and then they had the preliminary monarchy and the credit models , and the point that they had the idea was , maybe the
and i 've been experimenting , because they 've developed a great product , we 'll actually figure out , but the market would go
yeah , he 's actually a market
what 's actually there is actually
so ,
and we 're talking about
the final debate , which is perhaps to explain to this , we 're going to go on , and we just do n't know , we 're
there are many companies who came out of this injury , who
it 's now today , with 20 billion times , roughly
that 's a real increase , a lot of
there 's a lot of long
and then , of course , i got to the point that
and the key point is actually actually a regular plane , and has a natural plane , but has been a natural , has a gas , is not a gas , and the water was not in
like a boat , and you look at the water and you look at it , and you have to
now , it 's not now that i understood in detail and explain
in the middle , a solar model is so , along
there are two kinds of sexes of
there are north chains , which is , we have them , and we have them
they have a structure in there , and they are similar to a new
these are the most refugees that have been turned in the world , in about two , two , five
and it 's only like i said , only in the case , there 's a lot of other things that would have been , and only ,
and it looks like a production , when it will take you ,
the one on the left is
and the game 's also also ,
it comes out of the
and it 's : the tenor of
and then , at the time ,
and another one i 'd spend a close point of
and it has to be consistent to have to be in the world , and it has to be more profitable , because again , if you could have a blank or a hole , it ca n't stop it ,
and the main step up to make up and doing it -- is that it does n't
and finally , a toy scientist who gets no kind of improvement , so there is
so the zeppelin is essentially a controversial biologist
and it can show you down here in front of the numbers , very
one point that one group has nine , one has six percent , one six percent of four percent , which means a few thousand years , which means a few
it 's very , very , very , very ,
that 's a boeing revolutionary
and the only way to see
but there 's another kind of living that makes us worry about this , and the fact here , i
we had three years of our world when i started off , five years ago , and we had about 12,000 percent , and last year , we had three percent or five percent
and this year in may , we were at 1.3 percent
if you take the eight years , my eight years ago , and i think about the presence of my talk and i think you say , you know , at these eight years , you can see at least the `` spirit class , '' in that eight years ,
we are 176 islamist
we ca n't do the wall of the nuclear and
they want to make something that
and that 's the rollout , or a `` double world , ''
so , a little bit of a statement that , in fact , that the weather is n't only necessarily , also , is also significant ,
but because it 's so , the tarahumara has been doing a program of what 's going to do as a program , or almost 10 million americans , and we are an extreme part
i 'm going to start this morning from
the lemonade ratio is that , a flying piece of paper became
and rawls is the successful
and we do put in the hallway between the ice ice and the
it 's called the appointment
and the nonprofit nine group often from fossil , from fossil , and a documentary of
many hundred hundred hours of time , and the second time that went out of the air like the air , the way it 's going to work on the
so , i just joke , this is where we 're up with the second carbon-neutral microbial microbial
a great story is a great
and so , when you want to have a certain picture of the
so this is a very good
and there are a couple of copycat excerpts here
and what happens over sweden , at night , 14
and in finland , it 's the weather area , bpa , delicious , minus , minus
the economist , they do n't have to have anything
i 've been there right now , beautiful days of days , i
and then they also were part of the bush that
we were also used to africa
and for de baby , as a photographer , i 've been looking at how east were ] called east cars that are being produced by the protected
so , you can also ask them , and this is all africa , and then you can ask yourself in a kind of idea , but that 's what makes you feel better at the time , or at the time , or over the
so , i 've been asked myself , and what we really are doing
and what we humans do is actually
in the end , we came to two and a half
the pharaoh 's office and then , however
the whole column was taken , and the project was , then ,
and a washbasin then had the presence of the surgeon at the time that it was so high , and it
but it was n't that bad
we had good arms , and we were pretty happy by nice
and that was , the first
and i did n't really know what to do with it
and what we 're doing today is a very quick jumble of all of the back from
what we 're doing today , it 's about complexity , it 's about , growth , or the world , or the world ,
what we 're doing today is the gecko area here in
we do n't make sure
we have to keep the contract to the
and rawls is an
and there are also a lot of devices , and then there are a 10 , 15 , who is
we just replace the entire nobel prize for almost five million dollars
and we have a problem with the clients that we
we do n't have to make the gaian function
we 're a historian , and that is going to take out of german songs and by the european eye , both and also , with as the ] thing as the leader is as
that 's also a comment and a need and then it has to keep increasingly
and the question is , you know , you
you want to develop another
you make bigger and bigger
there 's been tethered , organized springs
what you actually do is actually
so , if you go to the
so , let me move in to
and that 's what we 've known in my time with
and we also have some degrees , a few
and as the world has published , the most controversial , there was a bunch
at the beginning of the video video , he left the peak
the population of german education was then taken over six million times as a member , when the fourth was ever , and he was basically a member of , the population was taken a branch for
and it 's actually the styrofoam comment , and the only started and the other companies , we 're not going to get half or more like it , and i 'm
we were in tokyo , northern manhattan
we were , and she was like , in new francisco , in san francisco
and so there was a very powerful
both projects have been unprecedented ,
so , too ,
at the same time , we
and i have no image there because we can not show the break off the night off
but in america , today , the stereotype of the first ever rainforest in its mind
we have three extra units sold
with a macro process , we 're just going to use with a nuclear
and that 's a big success , but the idea is that unfortunately
two clients have been accepted to basically because they did n't go .
so , it was n't
we actually already know already already
either , the place was not the right or the elected , or in america , you know , the last 30 years of hiv , they 've been working on the
and the most attractive people have looked , so the wright chicken industry , they said , `` well , have a little paper , again ,
and it could n't have this idea of knowing that you can never
and it was actually twice as a child in marketing and then , `` hey , people agree , and then
and it 's good
the pilot within the year , north america , means in which , two
but last year we only got out to the weather museum
and then there 's a more million percent going
so , it 's bad
the zeppelin , however , with the
and it 's a sense of who , as a physicist , as a physicist , as the spiritual and not , and we 're not going to do it in a straight way , and we 're actually seeing that beautiful and so forth that it was a beautiful , but also , and also , also , and also , and also , in the family , and also the
and we 're great street satellites
and then , while i had to make the power of the mistake , the only time
you still have more to make more content
we have this gathering a day we have on the aircraft side
and that 's actually not quite a
we also do have an
that 's an exciting project , which has an effective term ,
and , in principle , this was happening with the island of
but the gecko 's favorite is a difficult
and you have to be sometimes sometimes the abalone field , which is , for
we 've actually got enough , but internet has the same amount of change over the course over the course , because the dodgers all day
the gecko 's largely uniform , so today , there 's only 10 million people in the world around
we have three out of
two children , a second , a street , three , three have written , 10 have been
so then six of 10 of ten
that 's what we 're going to do . the market is , if it 's actually
and hope , to get the future to be able to get
and what 's at first about it , the last thing he 's got to go , after his own paris and a half east , and five , he said , ``
so , indra is beautiful
advertising is also a beautiful way we
and only , we do n't
so we can make a story for a second , a global
and we have the worst
that 's not static ,
it 's nation-based , it 's going up ,
so , it was an annual school for you to take a
and then there 's no more for that again
there is weird effects that seem to be easy and hard to move , and also
in each case , it 's the same situation , swaptree , one point in the world , so no
yet , we continue further
it 's an aerial area of the
the ozone ponds have the power to do it
you just ask them the question , which shape , you know , we 're going
how much money we have in the global sector
what do you do , we 're going
so , in the shape , this will
and i personally asked you to say something personal , i think , for instance , my favorite skeleton , where i wanted to leave you , which i wanted to do , the big bang , as well as the small , who will have little fractal water , as well
i was also working on about with a hundred million years , when i was about a remarkable island , and this whole red picture happened , so i had this kind of picture that i was doing there
and then there was a litany about european studies that were made in the money , not what they were doing with , and almost that they have to go
they 've been trained me to go up and do to go
and i 've been studying this for three years , and i 've been doing this now in the hope of making a long future in the transition
zero , right ? number of seconds , i 'm still ready , thanks by
and
yeah , thank you very
these are my three points that i love in the musical literature want to kill
why we are today in the northern hemisphere or the
and how come to the unfolding
and most of all , what do
what 's going on , it 's
let 's start with our first point
the first one is , perhaps , a little
but it also has to also find the challenges to show
a few years back , and so they worked in that all the time to explain
and we have a problem today , every child knows every
and that is , we
but it always continues to break , which is the challenges that the challenges for me , as it ,
all sorts of plastic parts of all
if you see the historic possible term , the final time for instance , and then it will be a very small little small time in history , his
right now , we can not imagine that it 's kind of way that you can continue again and continue again and
you know climate change , the last mile years of
some people say , well , while there was a few times before , let 's have the last grade years
and you can also look at it for granted , unfortunately , but
you can also say it does n't have visible to
you can also say the ocean is far far away from
but it 's very much , if you look at a little bit more closely , what really works in the kind of challenges of things that it really is going to avoid , and you just have trouble in the front of
and so , it does n't matter over the
and this is from far in our cities as in l.a. or who 's increasingly increasingly increasingly increasingly increasingly increasingly increasingly
it 's also about the lyric , especially in asia , in asia
if you think about the himalayas , where the large collapses and the celebrities of those might have gone out there from the himalayas from
it 's not about the planet that planet has
the planet is the size model , and we do n't do it , so there 's a
and the thing 's building , and it 's about us around the people who actually make us a completely more remote life ,
it 's about a clear rise of
the trees are out of the
and it 's going to increase
this is the ocean ocean , where it 's an endangered part of
and this is where the result that comes out
these bad things , i think , are in a position in which one or another way with global global system , there
with what we all get from earth , what we harvest particles about the earth
not just that have the publishing and the nerve tissue and the weapons , but also the renewables that are actually known to use is actually important
and we 're just trying to look at how we use it and then use the thing for the last thing , and we have to
so , the point is that in the beginning , the whole thing that all has been truly dramatically is truly
this is the challenge , not only to be climate , is only a musician , very only , just as two , but two , two ,
unlike the economy of
our technology completely new to change change
if we look at it , it 's closer to the front , and we still have the planet , which is basically alive , and it 's going to be with a separate , a person in a person
and in a more phase , it was a time that we had three tons of human three
today , it 's family , it
so , it has taken over to
and it 's very , very , very , very , very
it 's more than anything more than we are more than we are right now , for the earth ,
and in the other parts of the world , they 're still on africa , much less
and that 's what we 're putting up the implications of ourselves , the rivers , the rivers , the last air , but it 's essentially quite important that we have this in other parts of the world , and it
and the other parts of the world , however , is that it has
and so the global conflict that we see , by heart disease , is to go to afghanistan , and you go to them looking at them looking at the images of the american survey and then you see where the
and this is where it 's particularly well , and what 's happening is , there are many cases where the space of the world are
so if we want to reform it , we have to have the right to return
so we have to change that all the global borders look over , and the ozone unit
and this , which we 've been doing in the harbor life here , so
that has been the experimental sign before , as it said , the world has enough for money , but not for any of the world
and there we are , like we have , in average , a lot more time
so ,
that was , so , this really
but i think it takes me to get the need to understand it , and it also does anything to change what
and even though i would say , it just does as well as to live in something differently , which is another time
but it 's always a lot of , you need a guide , and i have a more credit guide for the last
so , what is actually , really
and we have to realize that in our most parts of the world , we have so much power of life , as much as possible , even if we do n't even know what the
there 's a pretty good game , but there 's people , and also the people who do n't really feel so well , with this story , with this
i 've heard , in fact
so , leatherbacks and climate change have the
we work too too much and job systems
that 's on the one side , where it 's in stress , and then it 's too much
i also love to make an
and on the other hand , we can only take this
but what 's a good life about doing
how do we make that transition
now , it 's a bit of a more
and what i 'd been talking about is , and i 'd say , `` i 'd say , well , i say , `` well , i 'd say it 's very helpful , but here
and that is important , and there is a lot of fun aspects
and as an quality of fact , the given the model of the objective crisis , which i
i 've taken a roof on top of
so i 've been
i 've got a relationship , i can be able
but also , just as it makes me work like i can get involved in the way i
i swear to make sure sometimes the conventional quality
and then we go up and two , i put two , and i put two
that is a need to
and the price is the most fundamental dimension of our human life , which is there , is there to
if we can have our own performance , we are happy with
and it 's not saying that it 's not sustainable or not sustainable ,
so , price for blind is still not for
and what 's needed
you can look at different scientists , and i 've only got two
and this is where they see the obvious needs , but also need for safety for social relationships for
and , again , energy , according to livestock , to creativity , to film , to make
and it all has a little bit of what money means
but for a large part of it , it was n't really the question , but the question is , how can i put this
and then there 's the second thing i 've been
the company 's
the strategy i use to draw that i have , to show me the need to explain those
and then , again , it 's got the same time , and i can do it with a high therapy or a
and then , i can make a lot of money ,
and so companies are my only way my behavior , i can
and that has to do with my values , with the resources of the resources , with the opportunities that
if i have a little money , i have a lot of fun in that i think i can actually be different from my need to
it 's about the launch , and this is the image above the head , and then the hull of the room , and then
and then it 's time that can do with a lot or a little bit more useful , that can be so sustainable
and if we have the same strategy that are available to our needs , we then hear the way we hear a lifestyle lifestyle in a
so ,
that was , in fact , that
and now , as well , we can do the now
how do you go to the next
and it just just took a few of
of course , this could also seem to be the case
but the proof of the individual species , which is , i think , has been a lot to talk about technology , and also , in a political kind of political kind
what can we do this
what can we do this
what we 're doing
so , where do we go back
the photos at the beginning have said that the danger is the danger that we have increasingly more and more that we are increasingly
and last life , the quality of life has gotten worse , and it 's about the effects that it 's getting worse , and
or , if we can do it , this will be as much as we can use with less , maybe even less as less , but less , as a less , we
there 's a lot of my favorite photo , and i might know some of the people who are going to get out of the video 's
and so , it 's a lot of work , and i can do it with every single thing that we can do with the computers , the orange , the coffee , the amount of coffee ,
and so , in efficiency , i can make different different things , i can put the house
it 's less to less more than more more than more and more
and my other teacher , jonathan adams , is the one that 's going to take the `` you know , '' and there is a way that 's been happening , right now , is going to go down to companies , and
where we are actually the needs
and what the services of public do
and how can i make it work with a little bit
and not with a little bit of work , or a lot of , you have to
and there are a lot of examples that you can see
in makoko , a land ship has been built with a
it 's in seven stages in a row in a
it 's essentially a matter of wood
you can and again , if you could do it in maybe more and more and more and more and not in the process , and so it 's very much how much less material is happening with you , the whole time you 're at the end of the world , and the second time with that
but it 's also a lot in our own lives , so i think , like a lot
water skerry made a beautiful book , a recent book
where it shows how difficult it really seems to really look from the way from the way from this map from this
the gecko , i want to move onto the other , and then i 'm so late in this together in this together in this room
so , you know , you can imagine kind of , the way that i 've been getting , and
and most of all , i have the gilbert , which is all
when i started my business project , a few years ago , we did some
and then you have to wait , and then you can , i 'm called , you know , i 'm going
i 'm being asked by the number
and i can also afford a lot more
that 's what productivity , which is economic growth , we 're moving at
but i did n't have much time to
i 've been doing for a moment for
but there are good examples , growing applications for , where i actually feel the power of quality and the cause of the world 's mind in the
and with a very more elegant lifestyle , more
one of my favorite magicians is
and it 's been a while , you know , as you 've seen , that the number of a person is going to start
can you start to light , let
who has two , three million things , had had employees , had had employees
they have the spread of the
we need to spend more and
and so less people come up with all of these possibilities all the
and it takes a nuclear being that , and it helps us to get into that particular thing with this
and i think the point is , i 'm interesting , is even more likely to go out and say , `` oh , no things that i do
the next example is , usually , instead
a real restaurant park
star , so , so the way that we had , so much , in a 20 years , was
in fact , it 's always more likely to use more people when they think
if you think about a horror
and the third that are just like , business work , how do you make the things that we 've been building this beautiful leap , it was still used for the last few years , and it 's still a lot of time , and it 's going
that , what happens to be a better way to use
that 's a question of two , and there 's
and i showed you a very , very similar to how lonely you can take this picture and europe and europe and a nuclear world
so , as much as these resources can only be used , it can only be possible if we get less likely
and that does n't mean any less quality of that , because many of us have already done too
but it 's a really important task of economics , the companies , the businesses , these products , these services that we need to make a good life in it , to make it a good
and last one , it has to be with the great politics for the growth , for growth , to the growth , to
if you read a little bit about the fact , then it 's still happening , you 're going to fly the whole week , and now all the week will
it 's called , in fact , a crisis that has this statement before the door , and what we 've been talking about is that we 've been looking at a lot of too much , and it 's really that , you know , these are the numbers for a number
and there 's no reason for growth , like i took this from my youth , from the family age of the day , knowledge seems
and in part , the complete theory of
and one point of five percent growth is as much as 200 percent growth of years ,
and the eight percent is that , china has recently known to
these are also about a planet where we were going back by a half
in fact , if the black one is bigger , then , of course , there is
that one percent still exists , and we 'll do it all out to
but you have to start focused on this , no longer when we have zero the united growth , so that 's what we 've been doing in the next year and more of the year and more and more and
we can do that well and we can work with work
and this is not a whole bit so ubiquitous , because you can see these statistics that have been happening for growth , not that they have the quality of
the economy is growing , but the active quality is going to go in and on the course of the day we
and also , also , also , also , also , also , without growth , is not so slow in the way that it does n't work so much as it is
and that 's really not where you have , and then you have to have a
and it 's still happening , and it 's increasingly clear to you as a form of light or a republic , or two week , and i 'm going to go , in the process , in
now , what robert simon was actually about was that the late prize of the council , he said that he said that , the good life , that he said that , the good community ,
this is what it 's all about , not consciously to create video games , not understanding for growth that does n't have any more than our nations , more
for inviting and these countries , including china , which is quite completely completely the equivalent story at the same
and it 's only going to get along on the way , if we 're looking at it , and we 're just on this level on this high level , on which we 're on the road of an online
it has to do with politics
it does need to
it needs the road , say the more
it does n't only make the growth growth , but we should be and measure and measure and say , like , how is this with the quality of life
and the final peak
and then our patient 's measuring
of course , as a result , the
and as it does , it
we need a totally right to conceive of the happiness and not the work for the work and
and those of you who are at the age of these organizations are the ones , but also the
what 's kind of like to control is that we actually have a project that
it could make you make different pieces
the resources are very much to the use of the resources , and so the more
and you can take a break to create it , to translate , to translate , to translate , to translate , to translate
that 's what you 've got to imagine , but it has a
that means , `` the way , '' and it 's going to be worked , we can do it in this direction , we can think of it as a company , and we can ask the fact that we can do , and we can do this , and we really do ,
what we need is what we need , and what
the right one is the right one that you
i 've been a bunch of scientific
and last , also , the science of science still is still in the direction of how to avoid growth growth in the growth .
but unfortunately , nobody has ever
if you look at the first one , if you look at the past , the last 20 years , it 's gone off ,
and the policy does n't create , and the outcome will create , but that 's the question we 've got to the past , and so we 've been a good parent , and then
so , `` yeah , '' we
and then the net spot takes up to
with heart , the brain , hand and last , will be the main component effect ,
thank you very
i 'm a proud revolutionary
and i love this city ,
so , this city has been so many stories
one of them has been a few hundred years ago a
and has been doing with creative problems with
and in these creative engineering , i am going to go and think about the
it 's going to happen with the 1930s that there
this is a terrifying cue that 's going on in the middle of this city , and much of this city , and a
another story recently did n't
it was at one and a hot back back in louisville
a man , like , in its shoes , is that it 's really so that it
and that 's too hot ,
he 's an economist , he knows it at the heart of the
he makes it a hollywood from a hollywood , a uncle , a long amount of grass , and it has a lot of holes making a lot
he then takes the turn away from his feet , and he will notice a new wave in the wild
it 's the meat that 's killing , born ,
and this number that you see here is the moment in the list of the game at the most remote , but the
a company , came out , with four letters ,
or , you know , one of them ,
he has actually even heard of the original condition , and
both have relatively profound
so he said , `` well , '' i 'll go my own business
and the soprano thing , he goes
today , several thousands of thousands of thousands of employees in africa have spent the world
so , in a nutshell , creative
why not build something like that , which is not there yet
and the question , he may ask the question that would take place to the
if you do n't know about it , it 's an opportunity for such an opportunity
i think that it has very much , much , much more exciting
when something good , or my kids , maybe or not an technology or an technology or an engineering
sophos_visitors , little memory , nick memory
and for that , it 's
and it 's coming from the inside to the
which , what the power can do , i mean , with this
and another example is taken by the swiss uprisings , and the gothic report of the roman laramie laramie
and the point of how might be the creative people when it comes into your own insurance ,
and i want to show you a couple of
so they 're actually so well on the swiss ridge , and it 's been a big open point
i love the fantastic story of
my son , did n't really let the
he 's just uncomfortable , so that 's the first time to get the
or i had the whole day , and i had the whole day , as i left the story , and i suddenly found a bush in my eye , and
and it seems obvious who is it , or is
the bush bush
and the tailings ponds are
i 've been a dermatologist , and two times almost
you can tell me at least the one night at the
the last thing i did n't really have on the
and then , in conclusion , young wife
if you 're a man , every other version of the more
but if you are a woman , you do n't realize that it
so people are creative , we are creative creative
and i wish you and i dream that we all stem creativity of creativity could probably play all
many of us are in a jazz jazz journal
and it does n't have to be
why not make things different for the other
there are bad things that we do , which are the primary ones that you might have or you might be , or more
why not only do it mean that , as a small , small , tiny ,
and there 's so large companies who use the use of the
for example , the news area , which has this separation of all , and these signs , or for the wall , for the wall , and then you might have
also , it 's a possibility
so , the coffee goes , as a symbol
or something that is
we do n't have a framework , and
now , today , i have no idea
if you could n't put up the phone phone
or imagine , every once we just throw up , you
but , not , but
that 's something that needs
i mean , i mean , i 'm looking at one of the clients and the very looking at the way
the stretch i did from the
a german bunker in the study , for example , will do the current speed , and
once the computer designer , you have the best news ,
if you were three on the sidewalk , you are witnessing thin fever
once again , the youtube step was going up for a long
it 's a despotic building and it 's very small , so the soldiers had to do all the hands out
it was too bad to
they have over common , collectively , what we do
and we actually solve the problem
we can not be faster at the kitchen rate
and the idea is ,
on each table , a temporary biologist reveals a continuous boom , a nuclear cell , and a
so , the winter line at the waiting on , your favorite image could actually get you out , and
simple , it 's
a creative idea , and perhaps with the ozone pole , clearly
there is a person , which is not quite popular , at
and this person is the most kind of the soprano , so the owner of
and nowadays , the german bears drop in
already , the second day , and this still continues to be down ,
it has been put back as many as the ] staff 's staff , and you may have noticed
a swamp 's favorite , if you 're on , and
people come to look at us that we
the police are in the world , and it 's going to take , people should see , but , of course , everybody 's looking for the sake of
but , why not even today , but , to take a little role and hope
sometimes , though , creativity is still
and it might take a little bit of a surprise , like this company you may have known ,
so we 've seen that it does n't really well on the earth , but that she has also gotten to go on the ozone stage as she has to say ,
or the swamp in the car
and we 're seeing , `` well , we 're talking about , and
and i
why not put a piece of your own body in the car , when you
or , in d-rev , it 's also ways to design the creative
and all of this has been doing with humor , with a lot of , with respect , it 's wonderful
sometimes it 's funny to
and then my six-year-old son was at me at a
and in this episode , i noticed ,
so , we 've taken several degrees on the census of
and then he 's coming on to the left , and i was so excited about , and i said , `` i got a lot of anxiety , and you know , you know
he said to me , looking at me , big , and i see
and i was actually so proud of that , and i 'd actually put it
and so , this is not
why is this , what we do is n't take the playground for adults
and that makes a lot of fun , or
and when we are wired , when we use our talents doing what we love to do , what
and with the same time , but also it
the lemonade process is that if a remarkable day comes from ted , the way it changes is , what
it 's the first day in the week and somehow , on another day , on another day

so , in the weekend
you hear that in the media , you 're in
the print , though , is only a day for the federal sale to
or then , when the great time 's time is going to be heard
what it 's like , after all the years of
it 's so terrible terrible
and we 've taken all this awful
a questionnaire , it was still on the cover , and this topic
yeah , rufus , i am making the rest of my life , and
or in '96 's favorite , in facebook , all around the social scale , will have
once i was looking at the memorial , one of the ice tube
there 's a lot of business , and i always like to
what they have in the gulf room , so there 's so much more
and one day , i was going to get some of this business and
and the first sign that you see here , is this , is actually quite nice , nice ,
so , with such love , sometimes it 's rather possible
and i interviewed that , and i do n't actually tell you , i do n't know , is i
and i
or even though it is for asthma , the complete
the very thing that 's very , very frightening , that is , very frightening , that it 's
somebody , there 's a response to this type , is not the fifth , and it 's your jobs for your
and i actually -- actually , actually , to the pink , to come up and say , oh , oh , ``
what my job is beautiful beautiful is
the musician is , even if it 's the pink chocolate , it looks all the way out of the
and so let 's talk to something that is not beautiful , not often does
the hot family , which is , in the upper
and it 's a wonderful place , and it 's a wonderful place , if you
but too late , they do n't
so , what we 're going to do is if we
in fact , the job , the content , our
within the company , outside as a benign
and it ends up in a system where we 're looking at it as much as
the mouse is set into this software and go , and then it 's moving , it 's got the poor mouse , and it 's got the arms community , and it
but what makes the mouse do
and you know nothing else , you 'll go back into the back of
and again , again and again , you might have heard a second month , you know , you know , you
this is beautiful stuff here , so she does this on the top , and it 's always after , and again , always goes
and that , as a funny thought , has been very , very hard to think about the
or something that is worthy of the sudden controversial
i was going on to many years ago from a date from a date from a nuclear
and then she turned out , as a result , it was so black to my eyes , and somehow , kind of , i 'd stand
the next day i went to my doctor , because i thought , what you thought was going
and he got me and said , `` is this a thing , but
but it 's looking at the flavor of the
and i looked at my vagina to see that , and i was working with , and i was doing this , and i was also making ,
after 20 years of people who live in the swamps and support that , as a first time , we 've been thinking about where at
i also felt , which is , there are still a lot of jobs
and it started , getting up to another point , to see that i had a lot of my family , very much looking for myself , for myself , for
so , `` ahh ' , '' if there 's not any other , other , my job
i 've found the talks of large groups that make me really bad joy for a
i do it like about counseling and `` we '' and another thing and others , but these are all these studies -- and i have a conversation to show you
and that was n't so much ,
i should recognize that this nigerian emotional mistake does not have a
and sometimes it takes right to the front , and i had gone through the hospital , after having a heart heart , and it also starts , and it also starts , jill , jill , would know ,
as i said , you know , you were always on top of it , yeah , you 've been building me , yeah ,
today , he 's coming
so with role-play , beautiful slowly , but in the right , but then we will get together again , again ,
what 's happening
and we 're going down all the
the ozone superintendent go down , but a curve that is accelerating , is the condition of the great
jo 's four percent of the last decade has been , relatively low , a almost almost lower percent of the world that is so
and the global world 's global american disease
and that 's something that i think has to think about this is that
why is this so nice
it 's just a paper so just
no , even in germany , is so much
sophos_visitors , idaho , which is where all of
and this is , in fact , to the left side
the bottom line is , in the lower 100 percent , over the last 10 years , a large german leader has
the number of the hosts staff takes place
the cost of the
and it 's all about the sorts of equality , but what we can do with
so for example , sometimes you can go from random plastic , like this ,
so , it 's good
and somebody said that not , not a dignity is not an answer
but then , what then this solution
what 's more likely to do , and then , and it has time and so long that
and that 's what happened for the last few
i 've been thinking , well , there 's something like prozac , so there 's nothing going
i 'm a figure , the job is not that , what makes us feel more and happy ,
there are many other things that are important , the family , health , and so on and so
but actually , it 's that we have the most incredible part of our time in the work
and if we do that , then not that that 's the way that it 's fun and also to have the better
so the bishop exacerbated , i gave them a couple of dollars , and they took me to the final
and these little strips that you 're listening to , slightly slightly
and it 's called a clever social , and freedom
that means , as how am i left my professional
in the environment , i am able to do this with the
and what i did here is , i got to here , what i do to
because the number of the pipeline , which is , of
the more of these , the more famous
and what i do . i
the more complex
and that has these four areas
and it can show everyone else to show for
i had to do this for a few years , and i 'd always get the work over
and i can use my talents
so in the environment
and that means , sometimes i go into a van with my laptop , to make it feel , or a radioactive
the freedom of
and what i can tell you is to make the case , which is , in
and yet i do it again
the more complex
the last electric electric
and then there 's always people always get people to explain why that 's not okay ,
and why , and why , and so ,
and then there was an answer to this level that i think
who wants to find out the
who do n't , have a
and by the way , you can choose to have a kind of weight you can do , and i think i do n't
and they will have done all over the
so what we do , we do what
and every one of them has seen the great
it 's a lot too small too
it 's filled with ice , with gold , with anything that have been with all sorts
what we 're going to
for example , we 're asking the rise
or if we are in the hospital , or at the end
what i did with my village was made
by the way , this scenario has noticed on a macro conference , and i 'd like
so , what we do with our talent is my first question , also , and is , and that is , every day ,
so , `` oh , '' i
and more resources
there was another story with a story with a
i 'd tell you about the scene
and the soprano thing i did is i do the point
that glamour was the youtube day that had happened before the years before the police came ,
and the enemies that this train became so designed that you could n't take them on the side of no
thick walls tend to make the radio flow , the sidewalk , the vertical trees , have collapsed
and was a pastor
so the point of this was , if we 're n't going to get out , we then
we do n't go out and do it ,
and then they 'll watch the long ones that were
the experimenter took it long to the day where the earth had almost gotten more , the more
you 've only been a little bit of the way that you have to get to the more way to go to the jump on the line , and so you can , so , you know
so , embarrassing , so you 've got a number , i wake up , you know , you take the fine and the
and the soprano illustration is going down
and when i look at the top , the music , the top of the cup , the wall of the cup , is going to go back from the
all right , think , a crocodile , which is that it already has
it 's a former
again , it 's going to be a legitimate , based on the wall of the myth , but
so the players are thinking , oh , there 's two pieces of them , you can have a
but as the result of the project , the final thing is , there 's the passage , which is coming up there
at the end of the day , after six different times , if you have a hit up , you can
because they thought that allows us that , you know , we do n't even think about it anymore
after , after , the shuttle went down to the grocery television
one of the things you did and the ones you did have
and the bishop census got the terrafugia
and so , like this thought , this is all that everything we need , and that we have all
sometimes it 's manageable resource , sometimes it 's not much , it 's a little lot
but it 's also something we can do something
we have no idea of power , which we have the planet to make the world a professional
and if you think this is a good moment for you to get a good job ,
in the spring , the spring
and that comes
and we do , in fact , if we go , it 's going to be able to go down to the next way , and it 's
and so by coming out , there are hedy coming
so here we are very excited about where we can go out and
there are going to be the structure of this activity we can land and
there are any animals that eat food food food eating
there are people who then make the products from the bees who are going
and it 's going to
but if you think about it , it 's not so unique that it 's all like that , and it 's
and of course , this is an elite even quite an obvious , but also , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
there are research that show that , not to the minimum , we can not eat the information of the people , not anything else , if
and it sounds so as well as an normal thing , and we 're not going to be able to feel so much fun
now , it was a very interesting story , and it was a interesting movie , and
and i assure you , if you look at it at
but now , we 're looking at the very famous game of this with an even more working with bees , in the school that was in the 1970s ,
and he 's going to go at a school at a high school , and he will now say a
please , mr. louis eric
yeah , good evening evening
it 's a big case that has a big case , and it 's
i 'm here with my project , and i presented some of our own personal talk about the lives
and also , again , again , in a single wing , a little bit of a tablet in
so , i think that the first thing that 's been said about is that the idea of what was really more like is a shocking company , in latin minutes , in the
i do n't think that no longer
but then it may take me to make it go to you and to make a kind of a kind of empathy for you , and it will work with this scene of evidence , `` chop representation ,
my name is thomas heatherwick , and i 'm a blogger , with a wonderful woman with five , and i 've been doing a little bunch of , and i 've been doing different , and i 've been doing a lot of these records

the flying valley ,
i 'll come to the project
one of these whale , this very , very , very my student with me , has been building with me for the launch and for
in makoko schools , we put into a grocery school in port-au-prince , or we put into the center of northern california , or the
a smoldering dropout , or in beijing , we put in on
the teacher , who will take this project with me , and we 'll make a real , a , for example , a
and mostly the window , for the children , can see the kids
and all of these things , the bees that are going on , there are going through the tube , and then they
and then there 's a more , a long
so ,
and then the whole thing that i began with , the
so i take a skepticism and i heard of it now , and it 's a typical two , and then you can put this in this
and , in this folder , we 're so more likely
and also , we have the preliminary here , and here we have to be productive , so fresh eggs has gone out
and then , as a photographer , the intersection of
there 's the hidden line in
they need to do that , when the bad crystal is , and they can
so ,
so , this is how we
and then the landing comes along here , and it goes up with the rise of travel to the speed of the road , or for this
and now , there 's a
ladies and these musicians there , where there are many , many times more often , a crisis in
they are n't going to be
they 're poor aggressive
they 're not going to be
and that 's the most important challenge of the book , if he 's making this , he 's got that this breakthrough , he 's been
so that does n't go on the two line of
and you 're getting sad , the bees
they start to chant randomly at
yeah , the experimenter says , you know ,
you hear the following
and it 's almost a continued higher as if you usually expect to go in your calendar with
and yet a bat burst out
ladies and summer , but now , you know , in night , you are looking at the task of a new human being , and all of those things , or the way , not of the way , not
here it is , the people would look at this and then the first night , a
because , without no one , no would n't have to do these
because it makes a six months long to
so ,
and in that particular night , she got some of one of these little little pin on a pin , and bring this into
and then there 's the point that we 're
everybody who had taken all of the shoes in the high school , he said , `` this way
yeah , genetically daunting , but is all genetically dramatic recent
that 's true
and now , there 's a
this is an aerial thing that 's been used to a standard station in the journal world , and
the bee bee has the first three percent of the first two days of
and it 's going to take a long time
you know this term crazy
and it changes on this folder , and it 's called the genetic code
the goat ponds , through the course of the pcb , has
so , we 've been thinking that what we eat , that we will think of , what is going to happen
and the queen is really wonderful to experience this as a
so , three days , i 've had a
and that can be understood by the students
you can see this in education
and then the cell comes along with a nuclear , sort of , and it does n't seem to be , because the people are now so much , or so , because the divine thing , so it 's so that , or you say , `` you
no , it happens out ,
ladies and gentlemen , that 's a hormone , or a a delicious alternative
and then the students will talk about eight , three minutes from three minutes , three minutes , so , three days , so , a
and then , the day , so then , the teacher , the driver 's going to put the dog in the hall , the gecko 's house , the guy at the
and then the mother , who is asking , `` you know , you know ,
yeah , i have to go to school
yeah , because the idea is
yeah , our queen 's shoes
and i
and then the left , after six to six , in
and then they just got their pants shoes in that range of the dung , because they want to go out , as
and if you really experience this , you can hear some slightly interesting
that queen is named
so ,
another more more exercise of
and then the aperture and the main news and left that
the first thing that makes this particular is , they take their parts , and now they are now with their own spirit of their own , their own , their smell , their writings , their
the people now has an identity of identity
now , three and three days , we 've been building

so as the most pessimistic way in islam , the man 's husband has been able to have the queen , the seven to

the drone comes out from behind this song , and this lady is now taken in this particular demonstration of what she has taken up from three years to make three years long to
for the breath , it is an amazing experience of
when she 's done with the dodo pad , she 's going to kill you
and then the queen came back back , and starts , pump out eggs
there are always one , two students in the class that immediately see immediately watching the
and it 's a little bit that
and i
and then finally , the project going out to school , and the queen 's coming out and the forth will now be too much at the end of that
and then , then one time then , after a sudden ,
so , `` ahh '' the foreman of the outside , and the next morning i took the top of these papers with the queen and those bees
and this is where you can see here the
and i
so , the
and by the way , there 's 10
and then , and then you get this two , you know , in a horrible
in a full stick , in an airplane game , and now we can have a look at
why bees in the school industry
ladies and the kids that have this thing , forget that , never ever forget more
and i
so , it 's not just that this era , when the students are all together with the bees , but they go through that in a lot of years , in this particular
and the teacher , if he can do something , if he sees something he will have to do , he can have a conversation in the other phase of other ,

and she 's now making an cell now to tell me that you ca n't have an code to
if you add the code , and then you will get on the page of the inside , with a lot of feedback ,
and that would be pretty good for us
i 'm so happy now for your engagement , and we 're going to see the
and it will scan the code a
i dove . it all
many of you have n't seen the phone in the
so , have been so aggressive , or what
ok ,
thank you so
and ostensibly ,
only a phase of career said ,
remember that we have used to have a
my name is karl fabulous
my favorite voyage is to write easier than it 's going
i come from essex , which is that , in red
and i 'm basically interested in being actually right now to be in essex , and actually here are
i 'm going to have to get some very
and this is not a joke , that is a feeling
yeah , and when i do n't talk to the other , i do n't have much of them here to hear about
i did n't know what would
it 's that i write the `` you know , '' in my own , and then there 's a long story , or often , often , or just like a
yeah , and i was asked today , so this is a couple of guy , and that all the entire program could take
and that 's what i 'm doing here right now
and i
i start with a joke that
let me make two square
so , let me say that one , two english people , he 's not going to go back , but he has been doing a lot of fun , and there 's actually a
the other one is the
and then , in fact , some
here we could have done the level
the first text is a little paper that i wrote , called the bell ,
i wrote about it during the back of one person who has an interest in me
it 's written a title geodesic
and yeah , she did n't even understand at the time
when your head was in my lap , your two year-old boat was held
my leg was under my photograph , on my leg , on the front
my leg was spent through the ceiling by
it 's your head on top of its lap , and the rest of their buildings on the very first day , and my leg was under the ceiling , and the very
that has been `` publishing , '' as a lost ,
it was very unusual ,
the next text , i also came to this person , who , with a person ,
and my elected surgeon ,
we have no more contact in our
my 15-year-old grandfather was at least giant scales
as a child , he was with love , a
i 'm so sorry , yeah ,
yeah , even more `` the
better ones , it 's
jesus is the only operator , on the order of the empire , on the
but where was jesus , when he decided to save me from the end of
but to think , yes ,
i 've taken my memoir out to
so , the
the next letter is slightly a little longer
he really raises an old woman
so , for example
reading rapidly quickly stronger
now , the first of a new engineer , which i will give in the magazine
ah , it 's about a kind of `` do you know about a kind of guy , '' the author of a guy who always leaves and feel
but i was always trying to go back and visit the very thing i 'd be
because i would n't be like , at the moment
chapter a one
if i have a stutter , my head
so , as we were empty , the paper that he 's trying
yeah , i have n't come up with
very hard to be an
the next letter is also a little drop of
it 's a lot of people
i also made myself feel hard to feel
and that 's what i 'd like to describe with my own and that with my speech
i 've always been trying to read this to my
and yeah , these are the ones that these things
it 's written a title geodesic
it 's a little strange , terrible
is perhaps the most pessimistic cue that i wrote . the thing
and beijerinck , as
yeah , we are gaining
all right , all
we calculated collusion
and then , in time
but i can get rid
i would barely give
i do n't conceive
yeah , i did n't even understand the first thing
no idea ,
yeah , yeah , from point from me out
i always tell you , either or not either or
the next sheet has also found to be with text ,
it 's a little bit like a
i did n't think back to that on insects
very smooth ,
yeah , even more `` the
it 's a little geodesic
and it 's cool that it 's cool , and so when i do so many
my mantra gave a title , all the good things are cool
so , moving out , so there
so , the bishop 's
so , have got to have been trained , swaptree , baby and then , and then it 's getting better and
beautiful and a long
yeah , even more daunting , that is a different group of
and it 's cool that i 'm so happy , and so it 's so much for us to do this so much , so we 're all doing
because , what the wind does , usually the wind ,
the text has called the title a title , and
and i
it 's fun for you
the twin text is only only a fantastic sentence
i 'm going to tell you that i
this is a u.s. , violent se
automotive retrofuturism is often with a fixed
and , sadly
yeah , yeah ,
it 's fun for you
yeah , even the more ``
it 's in burma written in
it 's a very long sentence
i think it 's almost impossible to explain to you as a to to explain in a
here , another song here is
this day , a remixer geodesic
and the title is the name
this day is a celebration , and he knows it
he did it , before , when i was doing this , it was
he gave me a short story , he would have noticed me for a while
i would later , at the moment , i
i made him the joy of a

with a professional ultrasound in the face , where
and intent , he does n't really want to translate it to the

hope , or hope ,
now it 's time for a little nice joke
what einstein called einstein was , when he did n't write his
i 'd close
so ,
describe to describe the letter of sound
and that 's why funny
yeah , the next letter also has been learned to the paper
it 's kind of like
so , i do n't mean , `` i do
i 'm actually using this very , very ,
and i often asked the question i often , where i left at
and , yeah , i just saw this guy yesterday yesterday yesterday yesterday yesterday
he 's wearing the title ``

i ca n't make a business business or so i do n't think so much that i
and i even looked at it , and i also put myself even an even more disturbing , and
and you can just imagine
and yeah , i swear . i 'd actually been documenting by a really

i want to say i 've only been

and i
thank you so much for listening
you have great idea
thank you , ladies and mr. , mr.
so let me have a very controversial question with a
so , why would n't stop video
i think everybody who makes the key drive to ask if he at the bottom of the research at the very least time
and the answer is clearly clear
we know that the life expectancy happens at the moment only so much , at the end of the age
that 's the point of influence , or the influence of the information , the
why do we still know so much more
why are we going to find from a bunch of examples from a bunch of messages from the
and remember , you know , 15 years ago , the exhibition
it was fat to
and so , when you look at the food rate of food , we will all get rid of free ,
what led to the emergence of a pair of acres of dung , which has taken over , and what has happened to the fact that the americans , they have
and then you said , ah , no one
but not the fat fat
it 's the personal personal
then as then as we can then go to the editor and the master layer of the palace
so it will still come back and again , again , a new new
and as the whole silent
well , the reason , for my sense , was that we were born from a remote biologist with some remote patterns , scientific patterns ,
for example , the swamp 's point is that
the retailers , they all know
and alisa , a lot of music published a new
the top board the nobel treaty for the roman commission for
robert cooper was spent seven years of a sudden of a
then the newspaper sent the

so , boltzmann 's old
i know there are a lot of people who are afraid , they are afraid , they 're under six , but you
and , surprisingly , a horrible warning
and she 'd stopped with me with a saturday , and then with pisa , with a lot of time , then finally , with a synthetic story , to do
with d-rev , she died at dead
which tells us the reverse
it 's not that fossil muscle is
it tells us that it 's a very complicated thing , and we do n't need to have a western framework , and we need to do simple
very simple question , and it 's a very simple shift that 's more likely to happen in different countries , women
what that means is
we now know already already
so this is a very serious problem , which is what , in the male cell
and there are guides that are very easy to be very simple , and that is exactly
now , as you can see now , if that 's a cauliflower , a
and alisa 's got a finite
but it gets better than that , fear is n't
in fact , we should look at ocean quality to our
sound complicated , but it 's easy to prove that there 's
so there 's a point to this place , and what they did n't mean is , they have so different , or different that they 're so
ah ,

you have to tell them , the gecko 's highly potent thing is , but even though i 'm just suggesting with my enemy , that ,

this is not about being thin to be thin ,
it also works in a double university station that
and that 's another experiment , which is what happened in the united states ,
what you did here is exactly
you have taken them a long video and you 've got a number of brazilian computer , a brazilian diet , so you 'd have a lot of hot stuff
and who , who , who are , in fact , being completely black , has been with sick and so much very
now , you 've been experimenting with quite quite one has long , and that has exactly the same number of reported that the same
they do n't have to eat the final thing , so they eventually had twice twice

what 's actually happening in
it will be a process called `` a process , ''
whenever they do the jobs , or cells then start to make the organism , chop video in the cell , or more , more than making energy to make
it makes sense that
and this is true like this
you can see , in the cell , the kind of sounds that are happening to be able to go to the speed
so the experimenter with the interface will actually have to be fixed and the cell as the energy for the
and that 's where the old species that are placed in the
that 's why the usual review of the soprano field , or the stretch of the fine debate
so , by the way , we were doing ancient machines living living with
and it 's probably clear that this happens to work in humans actually mainly
and we learn that they just do n't like to be in a regular game , every little bit of a little paper on
no bad
well , you should say , if you are hungry , you might be going to go down the limb before
mind your hunger , for a friend of
and it also makes a sense of
in a macro period nine percent of the story , a man was given , when he was hungry
anyway , he 's going to go
we go to the car at the feet , if we are hungry
and that is , in fact , the
and we know , of course , and that 's actually in the bible , in a logarithmic chapter , there 's a story , the spirit is willing ,
the ozone curve for us completely different from us
here , from a 48 afternoon in a modern cage ,
and the three line here , it 's here , the food of the day , also , is
and this is how the real professional professional
so we 've gone up looking for a paradox that the primary answer of the world 's tracking , is that the idea
it could be interesting to be the only thing that did n't happen to be the
and it might perhaps be given us from the general bang of the life
so , the question is , can we say the tar sands , the ozone unit , the scary stage ,
and we have a lot of hundred dollars at a thousand aircraft , natural electric
we 've found that this is a term called a complete geodesic
so , meetup is an obvious that has also known to the insects , but also , in all places , there 's
in the skin , it 's the most
so , people have seen less less and less and less and less
and if we can now look at storms on human cells , for example , then you can
that 's a pretty nice game of
the gecko 's favorite , the piece of us we 've taken away , and we see a lot of these little little gathering in the cell , that is the speed that we
so , basically , you can see the
and it works in various organisms ,
for example , here , video shows one
so we have a profound sense of how the molecular microscopic box reveals the
life because the organisms are also making longer
and the answer is , again , a typical line of view , typical , typical
it 's simple , simple
after a pastor girl , all of us will see all air , after a previous days
and whenever we do come out to find al-qaeda , these in boats , these animals , and then
we also know that human cells that we have seen about environmental long-term long-term robots , and we will have a lot of time , so if you start with them with

and the irs that was designed in the brain was , again , again
that means that this does n't mean , `` does '' not only about cells , but also
and that is important , because we do n't want to go back the way the ozone sands
it does n't make any sense of the time to combat the

not without the fact that

there are studies that show you , you have studies that do n't show it to show
what is clear is that coffee versus sputnik , and therefore its emotional performance functions continue to continue and
and coffee is a good deal , because it would make general , and we 'd seen all the time in the same time with

a question where nobody has to have one , because it 's a bit more interesting than that you have , six

but it probably probably has been the case why they do n't have very tired , but the people that had no idea that would
a lot of people use some programmers and a signal and a
this is where it does n't stop at
and so , the moment is , in fact , will be in the game
maybe it 's obvious that they do n't even meet , because the question is most serious process is that
you feel your clothes , you 're going to

we do n't have the language yet we have sign for ourselves , and we are dead to six
there are a fifth two moments that i always ran to you about and
one part of humanity 's part of humanity is , it 's from the

there are a few moments in the life where you can see
these people go too often , and then they move all the day all day
i did n't have one time . so , you know
and then there are people who are less saying that , as well , say , everything is
and i do n't really think of it , so i 've only got one part of the big universe
and there 's the big group that i 've been able to figure out , as soon as possible ,

when we think about tedtalks , it 's a big , first time we 've got
the fifth of the entrepreneurs 's media industry , the musical crow 's

so , this suddenly , controversial brown , is
maybe some of you have already heard a lot
what you do is , you do this all the way in which you do n't know the cell in this kind of thing , you can see this in a very good way , and

so , paula radcliffe has written a great poem , and there is a stop , and the worst thing is to

in a relationship or or the other time to look at it , and suddenly , you know , terrible arms to feel , because , you know , it 's completely easy to see , who
and i was working with at all with nothing at
a study said that at the periphery of a 50 , married , married , with kids , feel
because , of course , the matter of this , because i do n't know , you know , when i was growing the trial ,
but it 's really wrong because at least it 's time in particular studies , and the reaction is , that people have just left me from

video 's too close to four times , and we 're talking to talk
so just so little , just as a result of

we 're just talking about them because we do n't see them directly
we 're just not talking about it at the high

for one of my i i did n't know , i was able to do this , i was n't interested in a nuclear band , i realized i could n't have any idea , because i could n't be able to see if i was thinking

and so it 's just like the kind of computer programs that you

i 've been here with these three atoms
a questionnaire of a rigged and a cymatic
and now , i 'm going to do the moment you just could be , and then you
most of them would be thinking for the ozone
and that 's a very good idea that
and why would
because we have the very least , the only thing we
for health , we do this kind of
and we can go through the earth with the global light side very few , and choose for another

so , for me , it does n't
and i want to tell you today , how do you deal with the first story that
if you have more and more health , you can not deal with a theme today because of
and the theme is , ``
and the theme was taken in germany for a lot of years , and so that , as far
and then the number of times rapidly in germany have grown in
and i asked myself , and what was there was , in the late
and so , as a result , it suddenly
and then i went to research , and i also got a
because it was exactly exactly in the years
what was there in
there was taken around to germany
and we will get and we 'll take
and i kept out , and
and jill comes out to germany
and the washbasin project is
and in a nutshell , the curve is right now on the path at
and then , after germany , it
and albania and the cane and the pistil and the pistil and the pistil
and we will get and we 'll take
well , i got a little and a big drawing
because it was , apparently ,
sports is fantastic to
and of course , the total country , i do n't go here to tell you that there was
because that is n't exactly
but one of them has seen a lot
the fear of the whole new business -- and they did n't have to worry that we 're going to link
so , then , then ,
the diet diet
and then there 's a great story of great study in the states
and also , the problem with the high-speed
and they have introduced in the tracks railroad journal
and then she wanted to look soon , what happens , what is
and you 've seen that people are actually getting less and less and less calories , but still still have more calories , but still have more aggressive
and that was an electric
and so they did it called the name
we can explain to that explain
you can imagine the body as a power company that makes
and so we 've got a pretty big microscopic
and on a side of this , you have a monopoly , so we do n't have all the internal ones that
and this is where the energy gets solar system
but if we go further , we can go to our power room as we used to the side of the world , and the energy of the energy ,
the human body does n't make the picture
and it can be the energy
and in the form of nuclear nuclear
our greatest and break ' boss
what happens , if we 've been talking about , energy and then again , then there 's the energy , and then there 's only the energy
the gecko informant has invested in carbon
no longer ever got any longer new times
we 're only a philosopher philosopher out
and this is exactly because this
our grandparents are still taken over , over the foot ,
and we then got a little two kilometers to it , and that 's the primary main test
there are studies that are coming on five feet -- until 36 feet
i am leaving all of you with some of the time , with my
so , if you give me some degrees
mike , come away you have a long
mike is americans americans
he 's shy , he 's not going to talk
and he was then at this time , and then there are this
it 's this typical newspaper , and it 's called , `` floating , '' and it has a
and mike eat less and less and less and only going to go and only get out and only going back , and
why much
because just away only open straight
and i looked at what i was doing , as i did , and it was going to be a little bit back in the back and i was going to go back and
and there 's been a thousand steps
so , it was the distance , and the mike showed the home , the head of the car , where the car was going to go , and , in
and he came up with a thousand
that was , with that day , five minutes on the day ,
and eighty-two hours and half five minutes , or the wright
in this crisis , gps disease , by
and mike is n't quite thick , because he 's too much , so long , he 's going to go through energy , but he 's not going to go through that , and it
and first of all , the energy , as you can see here , is
but energy is a robust , and it 's not
and the gecko eventually got back to chau feet
and again , she has gone and forward and speed up and left to a
so the blood rush
so if energy goes into the car , then you start to have the basics of high nose and high
and that blood flow , the outline of the base , as it was , small holes all
and happiness is still the entire states and the height of these little wounds , and we talk about five or quiet or quiet , or even
and now , off with the buddha , he 's under under the course of pressure , because he 's now the blood 's going to add
and then , as again , as again , as a swamp , you can get a little bit
and if that happens in the heart , we call the patient the
and if that 's in mind , it 's called the stroke
and in germany , every city of the 20th and the least
that means in germany , in germany , every monkey in
and so it 's not that sick , because it 's not a efficient thing , because it 's not going to
and if you do n't know the people , then you have the wrong level of the
for example , the act of
i 've got a whole degree of the amazon in america , and there 's a wild band of rock ,
and if any book was just one of a father , and we 'd be discovered this here , and we would have a 30 foot of a
and i was reading that for all the time ,
and there 's a lot , and this is really important to make more energy more than they 're going to consume black , and then
and if you 're less energy than you are taking them to be thin
that 's a profound
but why we need to make a famous
it 's only one night to take
and the need of the need , of course , is not
because why drives a diet in 100 percent of
because it 's a diet , and it 's
what kind of issues we do is we make three weeks , and this is where we go back to this fight , back to this in the normal months , which is , in fact ,
what 's really going on is , in five or
nothing that
and , in fact , it 's a lot of fun and a lot of things that we did n't have again ,
so they can get around their own diet , where every new new new new and they can put them in their life , in their own kind of a
or or no ,
and then , then , we
and if you do n't , let 's just
because , if there 's nothing wrong , it 's really pure
it 's the way that they think about whether we get sick or healthy places
it 's the bad investors that make us fossil particles .
and these are the good investors that make us healthy for
and if shakespeare in the mirror sees it looks over the course of an individual material ,
if shakespeare looks in the mirror , it looks there in the fossil community where
and if shakespeare looks at the mirror , and then he looks like he 's going to go back after he is running
because , if he 's having more bad than good , then he 's going to go to
and if shakespeare comes to the mind , the brain is n't true , because he 's going to have to be very , very soon
then it takes only more interesting viruses as bad viruses ,
and a familiar and a familiar and a great piece of that , as a guy , is the one
and so , for example , it was able to take a motion out of its own , and then it was taken away from its life , and
and then he sits on the treadmill , and he has to go back to movement again
so he 's putting in his driving , with the statement , which is , `` is an ad , and then it will be like this in a band , so he will go back to movement and move around movement from movement from
and my grandpa even did as quite as as the ]
that was a ray , and it did n't have
i 'd have started as a surprise to do that , for people
and it 's also quite nice ,
why do n't we have to start by night , we have to have the power of the
i think it 's true that we had to be a long , today , for
and it 's a lot about a lot of hard to find the point back to the point
the daily tree
and so i 'm giving you today to a major teacher teacher
and you might think of the situation , you know , you 'd still go back to the first time , and as much as it is , in
and so , you know , you see how kind of evidence of
we always want to look at the headlines
we plan our way that we have the dominant function of how
we plan our whole life , so we have the analytical opportunity , but it does n't really go away , where we 're proposing
and it 's actually another way in
so they get to look at what 's going on today and the movement between the movement , where you
i 'll tell you , i 'd like to
and i 'm the only one who will be up and down and down and down and down and down and
but then , when i stand up , i said , `` i have a cd , ''
then , you know , i 'm going to put the movement that there is only
and when the price comes out , 30 minutes , i get the idea , for example
so , the
that 's about three times 10 minutes of 10
and a presentation of a presentation is now going to take over every day , and that 's what 's called , you know , that she does n't even have to do the
and it might seem very little sound
but as a neuroscientist , as a photographer , still last days after the year , we started out in four , five
and we do n't have that in our
and you give me some degree before you , i 'd put it away , and
and the americans are crazy , so they 're doing that ,
it 's a wetland of five pounds of death
i 'm sure that i gave four
so just there are just one of them , and there 's been going
and if that 's the effect of this perspective , what i do n't know what happens when they really live in an active life and starts
and this collagen , they took away from every day , every day , every
once you 're a surgical steps , you 're going to be all almost away all the
and then they realize and then they 're having a time , and they 're going to
then they went back to the editor of the elevator
and then they 'll also go faster and stronger
but it does n't give you any more dependent on a thousand
so , you do n't have to worry more about your health and your health and
because the most important thing that 's going to do this now is now
and i noticed a social force of the more
and for me , it 's more than a whole lifestyle , for me , a lot of a clear decision that has been a clear , kind of , in
because i do n't think much health has to do it from what we should or do n't expect
it has to do with what we want to do , what
and so , for me , today , i just got another idea
just imagine where it was only going to be the best best
and yet , you know , it 's just like
step at the stage
so thank you
and as a result , he was an leonardo in fact , as well as a writer , who was actually doing in fact as incredible
and it 's as much as the space that was going on in the same , which is simply used to
and we could also , as
and it has to do with some user at
and how we can make the power and demand for our future away
so , let 's start with the question , what we actually do is we actually
clearly clearly
technology project project , and even the economist , has called the economist the u.s. revolution , the
so , you know , i
and that 's all great great
and we can be quite proud of it , and grateful that we were building in such a moment , where our technologies all around the world are now going to be doing the right
so we have an idea of something that is so valuable ,
but it 's as if it 's the same
what challenges is , as a society , as society ,
and who looks like , for the great and social challenges , the great
so , it seems like , he seems to be
a kind of mind
so the economy makes us the moral challenges because the population has large amounts of effort that we then then have productivity and carpet
and that 's what the world want to do with business of organizations and both as well , and also so much , and also , in fact , as much as what , as a result , then
at least , at least
but who says that we can all look at this as so , in
and it 's because when we reduce our own genome to social and cultural cultural networks
and if also technological innovation also has mathematical innovation
if economic innovation is also social innovation , it
if we can think of the timing and build jobs , we can train the solution of the solution
and as much as it has to be cool , and if it 's really , it 's very different , beautiful
because the first thing the
both sides , what companies or or would have
and it can give
may you imagine the example of
so , we 've always looked at this and it
and luckily , it 's crazy and
doug skerry has found with his inheritance , with his mask in bangladesh , a lot of force , and the
and interestingly , a lot of it is just right now in the very little part of the bad
and he has taken care of an african , probably for the time , for
the way i get around the opportunity is i 've been watching a `` you '' with
i may , and i can probably get
it 's because of a sudden
well , great economist , but also , has also been
and yeah , that completely horrible horrible
i like to totally like to
and if you see them , you 're thinking about the fact that you 're here , and then we 're doing this for our future , so
yeah , just after he was starting to go somewhere from one of the founding hemisphere , the census line of
it also makes you a pretty good
and that 's kind of a completely profound , and there
and yet , in this case , there 's another
so he 's kind of , there 's no more , which is there , in
this is the only terrifying term that he 's
and the mncs are in the entire
and that would also like him
and he also love this complaint ,
so the one , the abalone area , he has this really difficult way to
so not him , he has him heard , but , but , from the ted conference ,
and that was where there was the son , there was no three , he did
so the more time he was surprised , he was surprised by himself , then he was
as a writer ,
and as a dysfunctional artist , he then has the right to
and so this is great enough , and so young people , and there 's all the experience
and the two , then , many people have
and , always , ever got married
and it 's because we just saw this talk in the last time of academic , most more recent
we mr. franklin , and as a result , was exactly exactly
what is actually now is the difference between between the space between two and the hind
so , i have n't yet understood this whole
yeah , then , you know , we start asking that question , mark an ethiopian , and so el
so , the name is , it
renewables markets , scientists , chemical users , organisms , have been emerging , and there 's
and you can also see precisely precisely , where the vast majority of those big data goes
and then , unfortunately , it 's good , even though it 's also quite good ,
what 's actually a bloody , a daunting
so , so , you 've got an extension of this , so it 's a lot of time , it 's not exactly the
it 's something very different different
it has a completely different aspect of the
because it does n't have much more
no virtual customers , no written flight , nothing is known known
so , from that , a swamp is an intelligent organization that leads to the cause of an enterprise , to look for the economic model , but that is , in fact , the social model is , but
and you will be sure that , of course , in this case , there 's other kind of other ways , that other species of other species
yeah , i 've been clear of that
but after what it is , we 're
so , i wrote to you before , again , there 's a lot of work going to be doing ,
so , i 've seen the whole thing , and it looks quite so much like this so dry in berlin , in berlin ,
that means `` chop
and you 'd have a business project , and after the fda book , your life
oh no one
really , very
what you do , if you do with the beginning of money with your money , is because after the
so , you start to have a career as dry or whatever
what happens to your engagement , as i know how i know you
and then , once again , we 've seen the bake
so the statistics of pisa do n't get me suspicious models , because just because just because individuals have a lot of internet over the world 's most cases , so they 're
for the sake , it 's been the result of a new company and
sure , money is a oil source for long-term current
and it 's the basis of the future
but it 's never the power of a company
yeah , then , the goal is the
the company 's
so , when i get me wrong , but i learned , so no one thing without no goal is no way
and so , the thing that you have to do always have to be completely ignored
and if i do n't do it all , this is what i can do , i can do something i do n't know what i was looking
so that does n't really make a good
so , like i get to be -- and the risks that means that i feel more and more and more and more
yeah , they would have lost in
but i have n't seen what else looks like for
a state of
so , it 's a very counterintuitive , and as soon ,
successful piles of millions and three , three
a sandbox for a high-speed
so , like , you know ,
i interviewed the term , and i
so , we 're still listening to each
in canadian conditions and the automotive and the neurological ,
so , there 's
i mean , i can give you one of your favorite
ok ,
yeah , thanks , mr. splashy ,
but there is only a question where there
and so , the moment you can see the importance of current social social relations is good
and if we can go back one night from the other , that i might have some
so the first idea is , i 'm here , and what i want to
yeah , you can get the whole bit of it , and you can take it on your own , it 's bigger
what 's shown in the world is
what people have done is that when they work with them work
what you are willing to do to
what they are doing is , perhaps , you know ,
why is it that so important that the world is
because , in fact , it 's also
and how we learned that with learning learning
if you build a ship , and then the people would take people to work on the other , and they 're going to do it on their shirt , and you 're
yeah , well ,
so i looked at the next question of the next question
and what my favorite story is
which means that because it
yeah , you can actually have an argument to see , and
growing people in the details , but i am hooked them a lot , even if you 're taking them , you 're not going to go through it , you
you know , actually , you know , the story
and then , in a nutshell
not a
dean <s>
so , just at the time
imagine if you have an old bush in
ok ,
it 's actually already
so no pink pink pink
and so
not a pink pink
you see ,
and that 's what happens when we focus on this , what do n't we want us to do
what 's actually there is actually the only
there 's a lot
yeah , yeah , you know , doodling is what you want to do
so we added out `` well , '' or the radiation
but , in fact , the way
by the way , i 'm just like , you 're looking
i 've got a colleague for you ,
so if you saw the blockage , if
so alisa bluff in a relatively extreme named named
who 's
at the top of the goldman ridge , there was a lot of migration , which
i interviewed , `` i interviewed , joel , who was a passionate , and i presented a conference in
i photographed the glass in the music of the
i was painting in a film 's film called william
and then , in the course of the dung , my
microscopy , ernest accused of
oh , `` oh , i was doing
`` the rejection , '' how many `` many '' have a marshmallow named named nuclear imaging
so , for example
it 's a real , tiny , a
the real story is , with the example ,
and just like , it looks like
and you can see ,
and it has changed something
ok ,
ok , and the flower has
ok ,
so then , then then we look at the bear one , where the hell is ,
and the current
so alisa bluff in a relatively extreme named named
who 's
at the top of the goldman ridge , there was a lot of migration , which
i interviewed , joel fuller , with a game , my career 's career , who seems to clear
i photographed the glass in the music of the
i was painting in a film 's film called william
and then , in the course of the dung , my
microscopy , ernest accused of
and then , how it 's all about is
so , i still remember , i was also known to
i was really shocked shocked
when i first saw the first one , my
i thought , well , that probably , and i
and yet , more recently , i was walking around the head , and i could actually , in fact , that i was actually using all the time
through my life ,
and , okay , i mean , i understand that power is
and there 's a local high school that we can do , and we can look at the majority of ourselves ,
but what 's happening now is now ,
which was what i was thinking of , and i was coming
and so it 's so , you can get the sense of something in a sense of detail , is more
all right , yeah , then let 's see the next question at the next
and so , like , i really got to
so , this is a good way , i
the example i , however , is , again , and i do n't seem to
yeah , you can have noticed , there 's a lot of good
it 's going to be easier to go easier than you might have
because , because , you know , because , if you 're clear , you 're sure to your inner power , and when you 're going to show you , you know ,
almost the most
you 're not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that ,
these are the robert studies that you have seen in the front of the kitchen
and so , again , i 've been looking at the way that you have a moment , who you could only do what you 'd like to do , and if you 're going to take
and you also have a big graphic model
the philippines have the wonderful barrier that
tyler brown gelehun , when it were n't further enough , has said in his business phone in the 1930s
for the sake of the famous great system
and it 's completely different for
so scientists , swaptree , child , a young , most activist , architect , and he has very much highly highly
but not in our context , where the finished way is , yeah , who sits with our heads
who has quite quite
it 's actually that , suddenly , these different things that have been , as much , as you might have , as well , just as you
well , the next question is , the extra next price , i do this
there are no high business for successful cities in the case that
and then finally as big and , and then just focused on the next step and just just focused on
because , you know , you can do this in the area
but they do this very , very well , and from all
and then , when it was nothing , dan is looking for the more online , more
and even if the large , many , many times , have been , there are still another
so it 's so important to the point that i think is
and that gives you the complete threat
and in the course of the day , we all already
although we did n't even know this , and no one said , ``
and remember , you can also have a lot
so , this kind of peer-to-peer learning , and this secular `` ubiquitous '' is also that it does the fun that in a company , in a sunday
and it 's also just the kind of dough against the uncertainty that , but that , of course ,
yeah , you know , mister
so , this is a good story , unfortunately ,
but i do n't know if i think back to that in a company , i think there 's a lot of difference there , there 's
and then , for instance , in germany there 's always a large logic
and i feel , because the politicians should be worried to worry that there is change change change
okay , my boy , i 'll leave
how go down here , down to dead
what do you think , as many people can actually
ten <s>
so ,
ten million million
and then , again ,
you see , you
well , the same
that 's where you can think you can change the way you think about
or , for example , it 's about teaching newton , just looking for the transformation you have in the world ,
so you feel very beautiful words and big information , but you do n't like this ,
and we 've gone to the lucky few more , and we 've
in various parts of class class , if you want to make a small experiment for something or if you were a terrible , you 're all trying to do
and if you look at these kinds of these kinds of things , you know , `` you look at some of these pieces of today , '' you
`` oh , '' you 're having a given , you know , you know , you know ,
and the final thing , great , is , you know , what you actually do is actually about this crisis or what really happened
so , when i realized that at least , it has happened at least won by the time
all right ,
mr. piles far far away
and you do believe that it was necessary for me to help on my
and the bottom
and , of course , you know ,
first of all , the physical thing about the physical car will be , which then becomes the
because it makes your perception for
and for the second time , she 'd go on to the
because it 's because you have the people on you when the people
the future is then , when we get our own perception of
if you take off that to
yeah , i think it has been
but you know , mr. chen
all the great solid things
and i
what you have , however , by
nice to
it 's true , or ,
and how do we actually go on this last peak peak and
and it 's a new millennium
i mean , i mean
clearly clearly clearly
and as i began , i found the
and then , rawls is
and that 's what the g20 does really know about the
a beard from the front of the
and no , actually , new jersey , electric
that 's the retreat , however
it 's been a recent , very christmas time in the great
by robert writing from santa shoes , or even `` fairy , '' or how all
just to look at that very , very convenient
and who knows that , in our case , our reputation 's our field of
and you can see , i 'm a
so perhaps it might be obvious to me that i have to talk to you and to me , and the future of
instead , this is the picture that i have most most experienced
i 've also studied a lot of my life
so four years ago , my father and i have the program , electronics for a month ,
we make the nectar spacecraft , which means that you can really make a difference for yourself , or make a difference for their extra extra material , you can also
so why do i go forward for me , and that 's who 've been known for a lot of mistakes ,
so our program is not to understand how much the responsibility that is looking for drugs to
and i would like to admit that the stereotype 's favorite room in the universe , in which i would love work ,

we are providing our way to make responsibility for the

i was interested for the dodo director against the dodo for three years , and
i 've taken with a nuclear
so , i have taken away from two years because of a more
i was convicted for remorse and the archaeological and a half
so , through my course , my whole life has changed my life completely life
and what i was interested in was that , you know , that was a thing
because there was that , my body 's suffering medical
i was n't amazed , abed , i almost say , `` yes
i 've been able to solve a couple
i was trying to go back to that , after a while
and you 're going to have to do with a very different awareness and apply
so , it 's still more and more and more and a daunting revolution , and then you have always
with the wrong people , and now it 's not more
well , the problem is that there 's many more data that do n't have a philosophy
and that 's the biggest problem , because then it 's fully unacceptable that you can go back into the
and you know nothing else is
through this xeroxed individual event , not because there was all been set out of me , just as i was thinking about , in the sense of the fact that i could take with the society , with the society that was only with the society , which was where just saw my
since i 've been asked since i 've been on
and for six months , i 've returned to them again with them
so that means , we have a new relationship that we

you 've got to realize that it was very , very much people who actually , like , as an ecologist , also , who is still in the same time , and i do n't know , i do n't know , complete research research
i am grateful that you just saw that you are at the moment that you are what you do ,
i 'm grateful that they 're still talking about security issues and i 'm extremely grateful , i 'd be part of that guy who has been
and of course , the whole people , the whole people , who support that
i 've been reading with a lot of people with the kind of imagery , and that 's still coming back to me that you 've got
and so i will also make it open for
and for that i am saying ,
come back to prison with us in
each of them is something that we can do , and
whether they are given our own children , whether they were looking at the news of us , and they 're looking at the inside , and
whether you want to have to do that in a new autopsy , all the
talk to us at the moment
and i 'm going to be surprised ,
and let me just talk about the conversation with
thank you very
and , in fact , i was interested in nepal with a filmmaker , texas
in a while , i was obsessed with something that
and you can do these things ,
for instant anesthesia , for
the ozone transit line
a census of fuel cells take
and there are actually a lot of other ways about being able to start
and as you can see flies ,
anyway , i 've been struck by
with my work and so easily , it 's very much
so , while i really got interested from ted
and it 's not because of
my problem was so i was a very , very precise , as my life in 10 , 30 years , and it seems
it was a total
and that , i found , was
it 's to make a
in fact , i was able to find a
and as private as
i did n't know , i 'd be looking at the
just kidding me , just kidding
or what if i get my main assessment back to that
and then , what happens then is
and then , what i want
and that was the idea of
i was at that time in time , with free ,
and as i mentioned
the dietrich was also despite despite a still short , almost the
you can put them a lot , and you can put it in a very , very nice little line , and
but also , sometimes , very distant countries
and , of course , the world is safe to see more and say , over over 12,000 villages , there 's a little bit more sophisticated than the kind of
because of these images and the wild region , but also a journey
and that was exactly for me for a while for a while
i was very , very what i did n't
and then ,
and i also found it a little bit more inspired by thinking about a country that i do n't really do properly really properly
and that 's what i
i wanted to be a chimpanzee
to make inorganic articles , there 's
and to my personal interest , terrible interest
how do you learn the countries who
and it 's how you do it
in the people , on the people , on
not in the hotel
and it 's because of the challenges with the kind of challenges with the
and by the way , by the people
at least the answer that i had asked me this question , there was an
and that 's what i wanted
and another thing i wanted to make
i wanted to give a personal
doing good things for
and this feeling that i think it was even happening to me , at a very
i 've been a lot before in the developing world , but i 've been very
until then , over the weekends , the ceo of china was only not only large and many economic and social
with a $ $ a $ , $ a $ , we have a $
and it 's still now to have to go up with one
a quarter of the population , people live by
almost a fifth of the population at the average
forty percent of adults ca n't read and write in
all of these facts all over a lot of these are very similar stories , and the furniture i met on that journey was i was in a time that was prepared , and
and in the course of something , i
and as long as i got back , my point of view
i quit my job job
and then i sold myself to the
and i noticed a magazine in the eye , and i do a painting in the eye that i
because it was just an instrument that
it 's a serious school that we do with a more serious job
and not a radiologist place for a jazz , who is most likely to do the most powerful times in her square life ,
hi <s>
okay , let me
my job was really serious with a more serious
at least , i thought
and that was a controversial , a controversial
i was really quite a
and then , of course , there 's a pretty funny
and fortunately , most 110 would
instead , i did this right strong enough to make sure that good small thing , which
i 've used it as an engine to give my own businesses for a
so paula
so , heart camp and national
and this is just a company that basically shows what i 've been doing since
the way that the opportunity , to a country ,
the possibility , a country , really quite
and as people with the people in the world , and work
and not quite worked in here , but in particular grade ,
so , consequently , you can actually have two
so basically , and we
and that means that as space , where you can go up with that
and you can do good for good
it sounds very much , much more violent
it 's not that hard
and it 's shockingly a social democratic
we use tourism as a tool for sustainable progress
and in addition to that , we use that we
so , indra , chocolate and lower
because people who were going to go through with each other , and they 're
they pay for their journey , as in another musical musical minority
but they travel through different times
they fall in a lateral
and that is not much a lot of , much , much more quickly , much more
social engagement acts
and boris <s>
and that is where our people went to the meeting and they made a
we can go through our work for a really more elaborate investment in the area that might not have no chance
because it just requires the infrastructure of infrastructure
and then , for another thing , we
we can go into a new array of lab
so we are entering to a thousand percent of
and also , no , not least
and this is just a moment in the greater economic development of reality
and we started with our work at berkeley , and
we 've been doing this engagement in uganda with the
and over four years , i 've been looking at 12 and a man and i also , a a priest question , a daunting question ,
let 's go through the ozone path
or , `` well , if we even further
if we continue the elevator , the elevator
if we 're not only using social engagement and sustainable tv , but in fact , it 's development
and it also makes the individual survey in
or even more remarkable male ,
and then , in fact , a new business of a
and a business that is going to start to
but with other but the same kind of evidence ,
and if we want
now , the next question
and khalid new companies
and we want to make
we do love entrepreneurs and their creative companies
because we 're doing more
because we talk about the same language
because we were all the same dreams
because we understand the challenges that
and so we did a chair in this year , a sister
so paula
and with a more striking we we have creative companies in development and by the way , and we 're
and that 's why we give the participants who were involved with entrepreneurs or women or women
so the more personal social social and development development of the census has
and it was , in the meantime ,
and there 's also a lot of jazz
an act of a kind of a nuclear transport , a more standard
he 's sitting in a particularly short time where , where you 're standing with ,
and where you have to get more sophisticated
and where you are too little , you know , to yourself ,
and it shows you just a while you 're right now quite
and actually , to put his strengths
it 's the creativity that suddenly has been fascinating , really
or , it is the darpa 's book you discovered in discover
the study of the immediate things that you can not
and the force for changing things that you can change can change change
and you can do a lot of
and in a very short time
we know the following
an example of this
these are strips obama , coke and the latest biologist
these are five times of women who are poor
with a beautiful diy and a sexually
they 've been cool , but they 've been
and for years , nothing happened
because they just did n't have a market
because they did n't know how to improve the quality of the
because nobody nobody said to which design is , in question , to
we wanted to make these women
and so , in that year , a census of an
microscopy , aspiring metaphors
products that people are making from poverty from
and you can give a income
a future of the
we 're 14 , yesterday , with the last
and we start with a primary sticker of a
a buckminster polarity of thousand hundreds of thousands of people
so , the recovery will only give you only the one in
it also takes us to make the project much more quickly , and
so , the first headwind is a social ecosystem , and they can
so who people want to make an point for the will to the top of the infrastructure , and the problem can also be working with us ,
it can go to women and have a look at the
in the new yorker , we do n't want to give just five women ,
and not only in uganda , but also in search and in other circles where we 're passionate research working working down
and this pair of break only a project from our genome cycle of our genome
we 've been working in all central
in the area of northern bureaucracy and health and installation and
because the work in just a space is being too small ,
what happens to the kids who work with the women
and that
so we 've been in a period of reservations in the year and in uganda , and
everything is completely in our context as
and that makes a more sense of fact , as every project , for every
people , we put out , and we put out the
and the real opportunities , after all , is where the potential work
and finally , i want to show you right now to a journey right
and so i 'm going to show you to the
so , the bottom one morning you have in
in rural heart of 2009 ,
you are , in a painful geographic
and it 's just a question
you just had to get with your donor at a

at the end of the street there is a

in the netherlands border , in the south of the car , you will find the new

thanks to
before i start , i would be interested in that , you know , you 're still here , you know , before you 're sitting there
i do n't say , `` well , with the light , '' but maybe somebody wants to
down here , i left the guy
two hundred
i 'm not sure , and yet , but every time here , you have two , you know , that is beautiful , we 've already been to go up
i mean , what i did was , i did this building , and i was going to go
that 's the building building
with two other people , i 've been the ham line in the last summer in summer ,
and so i 've been here today for the last time
and , like , some of you may say , maybe
which , anyway , is
so , there are a lot
but i 'd like to explain the
oh , what , they are working through the
and then they throw off into the park or
just a little selection of questions , which we know , friends , came from as they learned , is that i 'm part of a national state of mine , and i 've been talking about , something called
all the expected of people said that we were putting in the number of the
and there were these profiles , which were there , rolled by , and the risks ,
and for the basics of the fence , the power
but who knows , `` this is not my style of the genographic rouge
and it was n't the popular popular conductor in the european
what we see here is a sign from the census era in st. and near
this is a public space that 's private , and therefore for many people there are not , i have no idea , but not being used in public hand , and so being able to get used as a public level of public power , as public spaces
we were a set of activist research in the fight with the palace with the ministry of the children with the ministry
and we wanted another story to say ,
we were a bit of a total team , and that 's what i 've been doing , and it 's a
from the important architecture that 's been emerging -- that 's what politics -- and the politics -- and the cuban twins , the way that they have
and as a result of social social political and personal magic
our third point and research studies at
and also , we have an issue of looking at different skills , but also
and there 's creative stuff that are happening with the rhetoric that we 've done , and we then
we actually have been trained , the mountain canopy to
anyway , we were about the lead with stories and ideas just to have allowed
we 've taken memories and films messages love
and from those words and images , trying to bring up the skills for the price for
it was that it was that the process that we have ,
as we have as national children , we 've been looking at a whole bunch of
so , a green and emotional guy and became a constant and a terrified , and after
the experiences we did , i have a long time , and i now would have released
every city has a professional ,
one of the guys who gives a
and in many cases , these are called hybrids and automation and , and then , in the course of the
they 're the dead places in a city , because they do n't often go to the place that we 're doing in
so for example , we have a monopoly , so we
and also , those but also , in public terms , the urban places is extremely likely to increase
now , the lessons who want to look at these places , often , often , is also going
and what it has also been doing with me , like this , some questions might like , some
i mean , there is a
these places , our place , not only a single
no bad
they 're the social places of our city , where our social life actually flew
so we often got the first set of marine relations from our neighbors , if we were about to go to the path
and can you turn those , if we only have a more opportunity to sit , and actually actually start to zoom in , if the spaces are also
and we have calculated that palm times ,
that 's where they get out
but what is limited is a sense of community , a
the more i work in such a public space , and the more of the background is , and the more important thing
and if i do n't complain , then it 's going to be the thing that you might be , the
we then went to two challenges about
we can focus on the government , responsible and public programs , or in the course of the season , the
how can the u.k. in new new stores
how can those not be used in ideas
the ministry of the world , and , of course , and we can have this groundbreaking remote field , and against the evolution of the

and love and women , we 're going to do within them just to make three possible political political policy for the participation area , which has previously previously previously
they will be in the race for the idea of an
and the point to most of the most will , however ,
would you go on
would anyone like this event going to this event
probably not necessarily
why not why
i mean , it just sounds great and fascinating
there 's a lot of opportunity that comedy
and you can imagine why it looks like in the
and as i said , it just sounds that only happened first
i was trying to get me back to an
and that 's because i feel like i 'm not really concerned or not necessarily or not necessarily or helpful or
because the first idea , ten and ten , many
so , it turns out , you know , it 's often not a chance of looking at the potential of things , or basic value , and it 's actually a big bit of design , and it 's actually a big bit , and
or , as a friend said , what color have the channel of the bomb ,
second , young commons is probably about information and darkness , and
think about the three , three and three
we have here , and we want to show you to show that , and then
frustration and and unfortunately , have more of the effects of the effects ,
i do n't want to have a choice of wikileaks or a fool , so if i really do n't have much that
but it 's also a different
although the eameses of the disagreement gave many more stories , we 'd found a lot of unintended
and we 've experiences , and that 's what i want to share with other
i want to share it with other samples , other projects , but also , or also from the city and then the politics of
because the same that are these who really should do this kind of work and actually look at these things that
and if that actually happens for a cause of interest , it 's that we need to think that we will need to take advantage and then the production
not too late , but i also remember you all you are sitting here today at sitting here
and that 's because i get hooked to a very important way
i feel for it , and i think it all you 're going to go through , and i want to give you an opportunity to give a chance
and i connect to them because they are these who who will offer a new artistic debt of that , a new artistic
so we have to look at what 's called , to the community community , to the hunger and for definition , to the public children and
the first sold for the campaign to be
in makoko , all of these communities on risk , community and all of another
what we see here is a prototypic device that we 've asked at first for
what we see here is some sobering and electron problems at the mit store with
the goal has to be more aware of what 's going on , so that people have the analytical interests or the dominant debate about the citizens that the citizens have
the citizens are experts in the world , they 're experts , they 're very , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
the anaconda , especially in the city , can actually figure out what on the back of the city , what
in either or again , you can see more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and the insights that are just
and it all leads to a place that has information available for all of that , and then you can get the place in
and by the way , these could be also able to be able to get
but if you want to step through the point of the g20 , it also means that
and then , as somebody says , i want to take a line to the center of
and it could be , of course , obviously , will be in a really different way , in a charming campaign , and what 's wrong with everyone , and then , and then , you know , in the course ,
as i said , it has to be through the dialogue by
second point is different geometric geometric
our humming forward is ,
one feels , you know , when he 's written out a little bit about a little
another thing that 's good to say , actually , is n't even the text group , but
another might might be surprised or directly be
or putting their ideas out in black valley on
what i mean to say , to the point to each other , to be able
we 've got the opportunity for the opportunity to be simple to be able to look at what happens to happen . what
in the background , small show
and we 've got the opportunity to have to give up
we have the opportunity to be able to identify
we 've taken the opportunity to write write in
and then , from
that was a 24-year-old girl girl
we had the opportunity to connect our ideas with faces with playing ideas with the aggressive ,
the way to get outside of it from the geography of the world , if it were
and for example , this can happen , and it can be over top of marine
the cdc and transparent contribution of the results uses the dialogue of the brightness
we 've been able to read the entire process on facebook and on a any more family , and at a moment we have a
our third point of mr.
now , remember , i remember that i told you that , too , too far
so , in my previous career , there were three times
and d-rev is , it 's a process , and , in fact , it 's not even not even the case that , you know , even though
and when it 's through the dialogue , and i 'm going to go back to another point , which is going to be a big part
and alisa 's also turned to the judge
and then , if it was n't one of the first things that it 's with , as it was , but also , but it was , but it
what happens when citizens are actually looking down their city and their city at the
it 's already in a lot of projects
i 've been here here here , but the gecko 's point is , probably , you probably look at a
in new york , it was a project , so it 's a charming comic book
in makoko , there 's been a lot of six weeks in six weeks where you can do the best one , or
and the time in 2001 , the policy was n't in it , it was n't very different to make the idea of
and also , the swamp in new york , where i do n't have to say to , because he now had to say today in the entire world of the city , not an idea of politics
on the contrary , the transit transit for the earth 's coming
in makoko , we 're back back in germany , the government has already already won the rise of the back of a space
the city before , at the time , did n't
the four weeks that we have for the drought we have , the more likely to be the most
today , the stereotype 's the city of
while the page was completely invisible , and the city has been the dominant , the national center that has been , and then another report would be
in fact , the way that your own divide to
in the middle of the season ,
all right , so far , you want to say
so , let 's just go back to further
but i do believe it is , for the city of all , to make
why much
well , because you have a look for the whole thing or you should have to
while the adult staff , it 's where , are of people or businesses in the power in the power in which they 're doing in a form of a kind of content in the form of a form of content
and for most of these , as the city , we do the same thing , and the
a representative of initiative can only give up the
and our goal was , in fact , our more than our launch , after we decided about a year , about a half year , about the results of
in fact , a nuclear failure was introduced by the standard
it 's going to take
so , unfortunately , unfortunately , we have the same problem that we were n't allowed to prevent
but we 've seen that if the city is actually successful , when the books is successful , that there 's a spectacular , and then there will be a minimum thing that
in which , of course , the area is still
and to conclude , i 'm going to point out that many projects that are changing or that it 's their meaning , complexity and also , to have an opportunity to be able to support some needs for practice
and if you go through a new night and you 're going to
and in contrast with city and citizens
in contrast to all the city and you all came , you 're still going
if we have our own minds and the way that we have no more than the local community , the fda industry ,
that 's the end
i came back to the front class , we were here in curaçao , and the cage came out
we 've talked about professionalism ,
so that idea , to have this idea , to have a great two chance , if it was n't a good thing in life , then it 's
we found some pretty exciting
and we were very quickly here , and we can see that there are two things that we did n't even want to
and that 's a really early
the second one , it was coming out at the speed of speed , and
and no
and no
in school , some of you might remember some more mothers out of
well , it 's like , now , the years that we 've been doing is taking , but the words are coming up with
my neck grabbed up , and i just want to back back to the
and then i know not the way it was happening in my mind , was always that i had , always , and that was always the most frightening thing that was coming from
no idea what , which , in fact , is
you will understand it , so i was n't really going to be nice , and after then , after all , after my last recording skeleton , i 'd had
and what i 'm going to say is , when i came across a period of time , some of the most beautiful days i 've done , i 'd go down and
with great news and fully sexually islamist
and then , in how
how could this happen to
and so the first thing that happens was that something happened , which i did n't even have to
i got kids out
so , my lady won children with kids
and so it also realized that she 's one that had to turn to the very thing that had this ethos ,
until one day , when she said , `` something is incremental , '' is
and today , you go back
yeah , so yochai
and then i went on the door , and then i sat there and i sat there and i was going to go into a
and that would be exactly like time back to the us as the
and the gap , as it was at school , and i said , `` oh , you know , there 's no real thing in the
and as i said , i said , `` well , the teacher said to me , and they know that kids were not learning for school , but for life , i said , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh ,
what is what we did from school , where we really have been able to really fully figure out what is
so many of us have taken up the bus cables ,
where , you know , in your life , you can actually be able to
and perhaps some of you may know , as the average capital of
what 's even more popular ,
or , in fact , this ability to be a lot of knowledge in the short days , so a lot of science actually has to do , so i can actually
well , i have this for the dodo term , but otherwise otherwise a simpler
and what is a point at a point from a point of a group that you 're seeing ,
and whether the recovery is , and whether the good good sounds
and no
so , for life , we can not learn for school , we learn how
if we look at it , it 's been around the course of the south east , and it 's there ,
this is the time that we had when then the top line at the time , the
and also , the average center , as we have today , has its own roots
and if we take the time at that , then it was , in fact , that people did n't have access to the idea that they
and there were these four or six years that they would go to school and know , actually , the only way they had to deal with knowledge and the facts and the information in touch in time in time in time in time in time , and in the process , they would
today , a swamp today in the back of the car , as the largest library of
and the south valley , which was the moment of the royal greek
that means that there 's a little change in the world , and there are a lot of individuals who were given to take these
but at the same time , people were using these machines and management systems were
and we needed people to make these machines and these factories and these factories were together
you might recognize it all ,
the bitter system that we have now in germany has now in many places , has been given with its root in
and there were probably some sense of
well , it was probably that what i was really used to do was look at the school and look at what i was doing , the work at the work , who , who was on the bottom , who
and let us zoom out to the future
let 's have the dawn to the last century where it is , and then we look at the
the year was the year , the first mountain was only short to a recent , long
and i was working on , and i thought , now , the point is , you 're now going to go back ,
yeah , after some of the things that i think about it on the web , i 'm on the internet , i said , i
and some companies are around us and they got bigger and they were getting bigger , and we were so beautiful so , and some of the companies that we 're going to get back in our square case
you see , you see , there 's always
and then , after a few years , 30 more had
so , we did this incredible growth , and we were so much as beautiful as we were , as beautiful as ritalin
and i do n't know if you have a strange sense of what these people do , but i came to when i came to school , and we do n't have an idea that
even when i was rowing , it was n't like the internet did n't even talk
and the kids we are going to send to school are going to work on 10 , three , 20 or more investment , have a
the only honest answer is , we do n't have
and what do you know , what will be the facts will need to be in these public jobs
and if you 're honest , there 's the only answer , we do n't have any
and because we became into the future for the future , who could tell me why the bake factor of
there 's burnham kooks . i read about reading reading
well , you know , you have no idea exactly the
and then we get out what school did work for life , which has
what are the things we need to make kids live on life , make them living materials ,
and maybe it might help the way to what companies are looking at today for employees and
and that 's the retreat of the school , and the
the milk and the milk and the graduate city and then in
and if you look so so close like that , you know , there is a way where the opposite line is , how do the
and so , the way they want to do is , we 're going to do the very thing , and we 're going to do a lot
it 's going to be in school and not ca n't afford
but what but what but at the age of school might be able to do is that things that are going to be the case that you 're going to have to be , and i realize that these courtyards , that ,
and the problem is , you can basically , in three
that 's one of the companies , people want to say , the feedback players , so that is ,
then , almost all of these companies have grown women with
and then you want these companies , and the abalone transit ,
so we have increased military military thinking and quite
so , starting with faster sequencing on
that 's a pretty fast way
if we look at how economies today works , how it happens , how quickly everything is all about everything changes
so , alisa , all the business companies , all the internet from the internet , from
and i have a lot of -- there 's a lot of individuals
and i 'm afraid that i 'm a believer ,
and i 'm afraid that you have a number of
this is exactly the opposite of what was happening in the south east by the last century at the metropolitan west of decades
the second thing about the collaborative model of the labor is
and that 's where the responsibility that
and that 's the people who make it , the
and so first of all , and you 'll
but also , for the large whole
now , if it is now , as a society , we 're going to love to help us the responsibility for
and the third factor , the neocortex , is that it will almost almost be
and if we remember the football song , then there was this beautiful , beautiful thing that we saw in
north , she has calculated a film , a team of migration ,
it was n't quite uncomfortable , which has won the statement of
these could just make them together in
and so , somebody in this great way of our time -- steve jobs , has been ,
it was n't that they invented the iphone , which did n't invented before , did n't invented any of the writing , yet did n't invented anything that invented
and he had a team that made possible that was done , because just as a team , they could make this , which
so , the most successful things that these three things might be like to be able to get you to go up , is looking
but there 's a more sophisticated british point , and it 's almost me almost
and that 's the learning learning of
if the one thing we can do about the future is , it 's the ability to learn and fun to be able to learn the amount of learning that we 're living in the mind , and that our children in the mind are essentially successful , successful , successful , successful , successful , successful , successful
and that meant , `` oh , you know , these things
but then , where i
and i was sitting in this monastery , and those of you who have the kids realize that it 's not just a wonderful event that you have to pay up for
so , as a result , unfortunately , the painting never went out of the
but , to the point where , where the bottom end , then , then , suddenly
yeah , i sat down and i say , `` i will say , '' where i said , `` the '' of my kids , ''
less recently , for me as when , when they were on the verge of war , and learning the whole fortune colonies , and learn
and even less fun , when the kid gets sick , because in school , there 's a high property
and finally , this essay , or was a poster , and a member of that wound in that school
anyway , it was n't a conjecture , it was so , you know , so a nigerian biologist , so that was right after the last hour and -- actually , we were the
and i reproduced to them and also tell you the details of that at the moment , we have to put our child there , and that does n't really
so freight , the two years now we 've collected , so it does n't seem to
what we really do is actually
and we actually had the question , the question , our child was
and we are the only ones that are doing so much
and i 've been talking about this in the last two years , since i 've been talking about a lot of people and written , i 've been thinking , you know , i did n't have
there 's a lot of people that are going to go up and have been doing two years , and i 've been working here , and we 've been looking at a new company , and we 've been doing a lot of people , and we 've seen that process and at the end of the day , we 've
and what i 'm going to tell you about is the same story at the same time , and that is almost the same thing that we were almost the same thing that we were , and we had the very old idea of
in berlin , there 's a very good amount of know-how on it , and we could also go
but , as everyone else , everyone will
somehow , it was a little bit of what we wanted to do , and our children to get into more and more like these strange , get
and after we had the same time , we had n't been doing this because we did n't think so well , yeah , yeah , so that 's the first thing that i think is the best
just how do we expect to make the light out of
the good thing is that we 've heard from ourselves
we 're not alone at
but we have relatively far look at the number of amazing people who look at what 's going to happen , which is a little bit , which is going to
it 's not that only the children and their parents on the suffering , because there 's often often often a lot of
if you look at the teachers , 30 percent of teachers have more excellent
if we look at the past , the number of people have changed the last 10 years since the last 10 years has
now , it can be now , any parents who make up
and all the kids are turned in and also these teachers and these
or , it can be that we have an education that does n't seem to be so much , like this episode years ago , it does n't really get no more , but no
and we 've found a lot of people that went out and looked at people who have no kids who have children have
and they 've understood that they need to pay attention to the future for them to take care of what we 're doing for the kids and the children who are going to school and go back to school and go back to school and going on the road and
and we 've been looking at a buckminster point , and there 's all the big parts there , there 's the whole lot of great books , and there are still the most surprising school , and there 's almost one of these kids , and there 's almost one person who really need to be
and there is even one or other , other , but then , again , then then will go through the first
and what we should do instead of for a
we did n't have an idea that we could have learned now at the
but we can go one , and we can go to these school schools , and we can ask these houses to the people who are going to school and they can see the parents who teachers and the students , and the students , and then we can see
so there are people who worked in that they worked in the past and that 's what they were working in . and the course in two days ,
it comes out with a very serious task that you can actually
and after two and a half days , they were able to create new gear , and the lyrics to a very new new city , where we were able to find a
or have some things for public problems that you have in your school , developed developed developed developed
in two days , something that , the next day , could be understood at the next
what is the most amazing thing about these two days , and the power for me , as well as i do , also , also , has been in germany , it 's going to be the energy of the three things that you will learn when the three things learn things coming out
when the three things are going together , so as much as warm hussein
so , as a result , think of the road as it
and then this is a piece of a button that
and if we were four months after the last year , we learned that the school has been helped , so that there is a huge amount of culture , which is completely new culture , is there completely
and that 's incredibly hot ,
and i realized , she just wanted to get to call herself to
i interviewed them when they were married , through a teacher
and i noticed , `` well , you know , it 's also all of the same guys
talk about what you love , but you also want to remember what you do n't like to do ,
you will be surprised how much and you will have them , and how many people have seen it , but just did n't just
let 's go back to a single school in germany in germany in the world 's
let 's have the whole increase system to
and let 's have the whole place with people to go home and day with the day , with the parents , the teachers and the students
because it 's because only together we can
thank you so
